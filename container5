8:006 Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD
        perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again
        the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away
        captive, from Babylon into this place.

028:007 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine
        ears, and in the ears of all the people;

028:008 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old
        prophesied both against many countries, and against great
        kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.

028:009 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
        prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known,
        that the LORD hath truly sent him.

028:010 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
        Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.

028:011 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,
        Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations
        within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah
        went his way.

028:012 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet,
        after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off
        the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

028:013 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast
        broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes
        of iron.

028:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have
        put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that
        they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall
        serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.

028:015 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear
        now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest
        this people to trust in a lie.

028:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from
        off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because
        thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.

028:017 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh
        month.

029:001 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the
        prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders
        which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to
        the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had
        carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;

029:002 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs,
        the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and
        the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)

029:003 By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son
        of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,

029:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that
        are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried
        away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;

029:005 Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat
        the fruit of them;

029:006 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives
        for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they
        may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there,
        and not diminished.

029:007 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be
        carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in
        the peace thereof shall ye have peace.

029:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not
        your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you,
        deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to
        be dreamed.

029:009 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
        them, saith the LORD.

029:010 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be
        accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good
        word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.

029:011 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the
        LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an
        expected end.

029:012 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,
        and I will hearken unto you.

029:013 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me
        with all your heart.

029:014 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn
        away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the
        nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you,
        saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place
        whence I caused you to be carried away captive.

029:015 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
        Babylon;

029:016 Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon
        the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in
        this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with
        you into captivity;

029:017 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them
        the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them
        like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

029:018 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and
        with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to
        all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an
        astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the
        nations whither I have driven them:

029:019 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD,
        which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up
        early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.

029:020 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the
        captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:

029:021 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the
        son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which
        prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver
        them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he
        shall slay them before your eyes;

029:022 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of
        Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like
        Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in
        the fire;

029:023 Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have
        committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have
        spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded
        them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.

029:024 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

029:025 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
        Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people
        that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah
        the priest, and to all the priests, saying,

029:026 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the
        priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD,
        for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that
        thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.

029:027 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
        which maketh himself a prophet to you?

029:028 For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This
        captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and
        plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

029:029 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
        Jeremiah the prophet.

029:030 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

029:031 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD
        concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath
        prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to
        trust in a lie:

029:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah
        the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell
        among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I
        will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught
        rebellion against the LORD.

030:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

030:002 Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all
        the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.

030:003 For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring
        again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the
        LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave
        to their fathers, and they shall possess it.

030:004 And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel
        and concerning Judah.

030:005 For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling,
        of fear, and not of peace.

030:006 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
        wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a
        woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?

030:007 Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is
        even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of
        it.

030:008 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of
        hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will
        burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves
        of him:

030:009 But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king,
        whom I will raise up unto them.

030:010 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;
        neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from
        afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob
        shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none
        shall make him afraid.

030:011 For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I
        make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee,
        yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct
        thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether
        unpunished.

030:012 For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy
        wound is grievous.

030:013 There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound
        up: thou hast no healing medicines.

030:014 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I
        have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the
        chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine
        iniquity; because thy sins were increased.

030:015 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable
        for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were
        increased, I have done these things unto thee.

030:016 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all
        thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity;
        and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey
        upon thee will I give for a prey.

030:017 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of
        thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an
        Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.

030:018 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity
        of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and
        the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace
        shall remain after the manner thereof.

030:019 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of
        them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall
        not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be
        small.

030:020 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their
        congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish
        all that oppress them.

030:021 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor
        shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to
        draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that
        engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.

030:022 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

030:023 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a
        continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of
        the wicked.

030:024 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath
        done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart:
        in the latter days ye shall consider it.

031:001 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the
        families of Israel, and they shall be my people.

031:002 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword
        found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to
        cause him to rest.

031:003 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have
        loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
        lovingkindness have I drawn thee.

031:004 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of
        Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and
        shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.

031:005 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
        planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.

031:006 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
        Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the
        LORD our God.

031:007 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and
        shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye,
        and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.

031:008 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather
        them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and
        the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with
        child together: a great company shall return thither.

031:009 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I
        lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters
        in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a
        father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.

031:010 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the
        isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather
        him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.

031:011 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the
        hand of him that was stronger than he.

031:012 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and
        shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat,
        and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and
        of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and
        they shall not sorrow any more at all.

031:013 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and
        old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and
        will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.

031:014 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and
        my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.

031:015 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
        and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to
        be comforted for her children, because they were not.

031:016 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine
        eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the
        LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.

031:017 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy
        children shall come again to their own border.

031:018 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
        chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed
        to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art
        the LORD my God.

031:019 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I
        was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea,
        even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.

031:020 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I
        spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still:
        therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have
        mercy upon him, saith the LORD.

031:021 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart
        toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn
        again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.

031:022 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for
        the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall
        compass a man.

031:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they
        shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities
        thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD
        bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.

031:024 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities
        thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with
        flocks.

031:025 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished
        every sorrowful soul.

031:026 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto
        me.

031:027 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the
        house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man,
        and with the seed of beast.

031:028 And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over
        them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and
        to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to
        build, and to plant, saith the LORD.

031:029 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a
        sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.

031:030 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
        eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.

031:031 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
        covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of
        Judah:

031:032 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
        in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of
        the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I
        was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:

031:033 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house
        of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law
        in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will
        be their God, and they shall be my people.

031:034 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
        every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall
        all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
        saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
        remember their sin no more.

031:035 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
        and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by
        night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The
        LORD of hosts is his name:

031:036 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD,
        then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation
        before me for ever.

031:037 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
        foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also
        cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done,
        saith the LORD.

031:038 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be
        built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of
        the corner.

031:039 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon
        the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.

031:040 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and
        all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of
        the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD;
        it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

032:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year
        of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of
        Nebuchadrezzar.

032:002 For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and
        Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison,
        which was in the king of Judah's house.

032:003 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore
        dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I
        will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and
        he shall take it;

032:004 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of
        the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of
        the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth,
        and his eyes shall behold his eyes;

032:005 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be
        until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the
        Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.

032:006 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

032:007 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come
        unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for
        the right of redemption is thine to buy it.

032:008 So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the
        prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me,
        Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in
        the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is
        thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I
        knew that this was the word of the LORD.

032:009 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in
        Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of
        silver.

032:010 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took
        witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.

032:011 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was
        sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was
        open:

032:012 And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of
        Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine
        uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that
        subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that
        sat in the court of the prison.

032:013 And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

032:014 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these
        evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is
        sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an
        earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.

032:015 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses
        and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this
        land.

032:016 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
        Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,

032:017 Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth
        by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing
        too hard for thee:

032:018 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest
        the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children
        after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is
        his name,

032:019 Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open
        upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one
        according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
        doings:

032:020 Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even
        unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast
        made thee a name, as at this day;

032:021 And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of
        Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand,
        and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;

032:022 And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their
        fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;

032:023 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy
        voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of
        all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast
        caused all this evil to come upon them:

032:024 Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and
        the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight
        against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of
        the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass;
        and, behold, thou seest it.

032:025 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for
        money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand
        of the Chaldeans.

032:026 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

032:027 Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any
        thing too hard for me?

032:028 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city
        into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:

032:029 And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come
        and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon
        whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured
        out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.

032:030 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only
        done evil before me from their youth: for the children of
        Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their
        hands, saith the LORD.

032:031 For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger
        and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this
        day; that I should remove it from before my face,

032:032 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
        children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to
        anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and
        their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of
        Jerusalem.

032:033 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face:
        though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet
        they have not hearkened to receive instruction.

032:034 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called
        by my name, to defile it.

032:035 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the
        valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their
        daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I
        commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they
        should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.

032:036 And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
        concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered
        into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the
        famine, and by the pestilence;

032:037 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I
        have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great
        wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will
        cause them to dwell safely:

032:038 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:

032:039 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may
        fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children
        after them:

032:040 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will
        not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my
        fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.

032:041 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will
        plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with
        my whole soul.

032:042 For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great
        evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good
        that I have promised them.

032:043 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is
        desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of
        the Chaldeans.

032:044 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
        seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in
        the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in
        the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley,
        and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their
        captivity to return, saith the LORD.

033:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second
        time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison,
        saying,

033:002 Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed
        it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;

033:003 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and
        mighty things, which thou knowest not.

033:004 For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the
        houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of
        Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;

033:005 They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them
        with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger
        and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my
        face from this city.

033:006 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,
        and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.

033:007 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
        Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.

033:008 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they
        have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their
        iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have
        transgressed against me.

033:009 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
        before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the
        good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for
        all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure
        unto it.

033:010 Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place,
        which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast,
        even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem,
        that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and
        without beast,

033:011 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
        bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that
        shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for
        his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the
        sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will
        cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first,
        saith the LORD.

033:012 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is
        desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities
        thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their
        flocks to lie down.

033:013 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and
        in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and
        in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,
        shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that
        telleth them, saith the LORD.

033:014 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform
        that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel
        and to the house of Judah.

033:015 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
        righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute
        judgment and righteousness in the land.

033:016 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
        safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called,
        The LORD our righteousness.

033:017 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit
        upon the throne of the house of Israel;

033:018 Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to
        offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do
        sacrifice continually.

033:019 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,

033:020 Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day,
        and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day
        and night in their season;

033:021 Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant,
        that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and
        with the Levites the priests, my ministers.

033:022 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of
        the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my
        servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.

033:023 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,

033:024 Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The
        two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast
        them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should
        be no more a nation before them.

033:025 Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,
        and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and
        earth;

033:026 Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant,
        so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the
        seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their
        captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

034:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the
        kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people,
        fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof,
        saying,

034:002 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to
        Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD;
        Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of
        Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:

034:003 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be
        taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall
        behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak
        with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.

034:004 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus
        saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:

034:005 But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy
        fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall
        they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying,
        Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.

034:006 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
        king of Judah in Jerusalem,

034:007 When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and
        against all the cities of Judah that were left, against
        Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities
        remained of the cities of Judah.

034:008 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after
        that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people
        which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;

034:009 That every man should let his manservant, and every man his
        maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that
        none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his
        brother.

034:010 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had
        entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his
        manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none
        should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed,
        and let them go.

034:011 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
        handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought
        them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.

034:012 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
        saying,

034:013 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with
        your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the
        land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,

034:014 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an
        Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath
        served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee:
        but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their
        ear.

034:015 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
        proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had
        made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my
        name:

034:016 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his
        servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at
        liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into
        subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.

034:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me,
        in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every
        man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you,
        saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the
        famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the
        kingdoms of the earth.

034:018 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
        which have not performed the words of the covenant which they
        had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and
        passed between the parts thereof,

034:019 The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the
        eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land,
        which passed between the parts of the calf;

034:020 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into
        the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies
        shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the
        beasts of the earth.

034:021 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into
        the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek
        their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,
        which are gone up from you.

034:022 Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to
        return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take
        it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah
        a desolation without an inhabitant.

035:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
        Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

035:002 Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and
        bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the
        chambers, and give them wine to drink.

035:003 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of
        Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole
        house of the Rechabites;

035:004 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the
        chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of
        God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above
        the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the
        door:

035:005 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots
        full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.

035:006 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
        Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no
        wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:

035:007 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant
        vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in
        tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be
        strangers.

035:008 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
        father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all
        our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;

035:009 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we
        vineyard, nor field, nor seed:

035:010 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done
        according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

035:011 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came
        up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to
        Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear
        of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.

035:012 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

035:013 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell
        the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not
        receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.

035:014 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his
        sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they
        drink none, but obey their father's commandment:
        notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and
        speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.

035:015 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
        up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man
        from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after
        other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which
        I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not
        inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.

035:016 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed
        the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but
        this people hath not hearkened unto me:

035:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them:
        because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and
        I have called unto them, but they have not answered.

035:018 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith
        the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed
        the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his
        precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded
        you:

035:019 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before
        me for ever.

036:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
        Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from
        the LORD, saying,

036:002 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words
        that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against
        Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto
        thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.

036:003 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which
        I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from
        his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

036:004 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch
        wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD,
        which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

036:005 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot
        go into the house of the LORD:

036:006 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast
        written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of
        the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also
        thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of
        their cities.

036:007 It may be they will present their supplication before the
        LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great
        is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced
        against this people.

036:008 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that
        Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the
        words of the LORD in the LORD's house.

036:009 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
        Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed
        a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to
        all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto
        Jerusalem.

036:010 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the
        house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of
        Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the
        new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.

036:011 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had
        heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,

036:012 Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's
        chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the
        scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son
        of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the
        son of Hananiah, and all the princes.

036:013 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
        heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.

036:014 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah,
        the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying,
        Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears
        of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the
        roll in his hand, and came unto them.

036:015 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
        So Baruch read it in their ears.

036:016 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they
        were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will
        surely tell the king of all these words.

036:017 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou
        write all these words at his mouth?

036:018 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto
        me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.

036:019 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
        Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.

036:020 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up
        the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all
        the words in the ears of the king.

036:021 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out
        of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the
        ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which
        stood beside the king.

036:022 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and
        there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.

036:023 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four
        leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire
        that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the
        fire that was on the hearth.

036:024 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the
        king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.

036:025 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
        intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but
        he would not hear them.

036:026 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
        Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to
        take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD
        hid them.

036:027 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the
        king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at
        the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

036:028 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former
        words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of
        Judah hath burned.

036:029 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the
        LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou
        written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly
        come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from
        thence man and beast?

036:030 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He
        shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead
        body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the
        night to the frost.

036:031 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
        iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I
        have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.

036:032 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
        scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of
        Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of
        Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides
        unto them many like words.

037:001 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah
        the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made
        king in the land of Judah.

037:002 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land,
        did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the
        prophet Jeremiah.

037:003 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
        Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet
        Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.

037:004 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they
        had not put him into prison.

037:005 Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the
        Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they
        departed from Jerusalem.

037:006 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah
        saying,

037:007 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to
        the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me;
        Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall
        return to Egypt into their own land.

037:008 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this
        city, and take it, and burn it with fire.

037:009 Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The
        Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not
        depart.

037:010 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that
        fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among
        them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn
        this city with fire.

037:011 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was
        broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,

037:012 Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land
        of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the
        people.

037:013 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward
        was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the
        son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
        Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.

037:014 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the
        Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took
        Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.

037:015 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,
        and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for
        they had made that the prison.

037:016 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the
        cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;

037:017 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king
        asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word
        from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou
        shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.

037:018 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I
        offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against
        this people, that ye have put me in prison?

037:019 Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying,
        The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against
        this land?

037:020 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my
        supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou
        cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe,
        lest I die there.

037:021 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit
        Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should
        give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street,
        until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah
        remained in the court of the prison.

038:001 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
        Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of
        Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all
        the people, saying,

038:002 Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die
        by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he
        that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall
        have his life for a prey, and shall live.

038:003 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the
        hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.

038:004 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
        this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of
        the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all
        the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man
        seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.

038:005 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for
        the king is not he that can do any thing against you.

038:006 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
        Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the
        prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the
        dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the
        mire.

038:007 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which
        was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in
        the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;

038:008 Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to
        the king saying,

038:009 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they
        have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into
        the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place
        where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.

038:010 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take
        from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the
        prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.

038:011 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house
        of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast
        clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into
        the dungeon to Jeremiah.

038:012 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these
        old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the
        cords. And Jeremiah did so.

038:013 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of
        the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

038:014 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet
        unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the
        LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a
        thing; hide nothing from me.

038:015 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
        wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee
        counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?

038:016 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As
        the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee
        to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men
        that seek thy life.

038:017 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God
        of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth
        unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live,
        and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt
        live, and thine house:

038:018 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's
        princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the
        Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt
        not escape out of their hand.

038:019 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
        Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me
        into their hand, and they mock me.

038:020 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I
        beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee:
        so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.

038:021 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD
        hath shewed me:

038:022 And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of
        Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's
        princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee
        on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the
        mire, and they are turned away back.

038:023 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
        Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but
        shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou
        shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.

038:024 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
        words, and thou shalt not die.

038:025 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
        come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what
        thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will
        not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:

038:026 Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication
        before the king, that he would not cause me to return to
        Jonathan's house, to die there.

038:027 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
        told them according to all these words that the king had
        commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter
        was not perceived.

038:028 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day
        that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was
        taken.

039:001 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth
        month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army
        against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.

039:002 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the
        ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.

039:003 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in
        the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim,
        Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the
        princes of the king of Babylon.

039:004 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
        them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth
        out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by
        the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the
        plain.

039:005 But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook
        Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken
        him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzarto
        Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.

039:006 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
        before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles
        of Judah.

039:007 Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with
        chains, to carry him to Babylon.

039:008 And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of
        the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.

039:009 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
        into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the
        city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the
        rest of the people that remained.

039:010 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of
        the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave
        them vineyards and fields at the same time.

039:011 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
        Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,

039:012 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do
        unto him even as he shall say unto thee.

039:013 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
        Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of
        Babylon's princes;

039:014 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the
        prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the
        son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt
        among the people.

039:015 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut
        up in the court of the prison, saying,

039:016 Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith
        the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my
        words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they
        shall be accomplished in that day before thee.

039:017 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou
        shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art
        afraid.

039:018 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
        sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because
        thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.

040:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
        Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from
        Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all
        that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which
        were carried away captive unto Babylon.

040:002 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
        The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

040:003 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath
        said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not
        obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.

040:004 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which
        were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with
        me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if
        it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear:
        behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good
        and convenient for thee to go, thither go.

040:005 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
        Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king
        of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and
        dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth
        convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave
        him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

040:006 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
        and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the
        land.

040:007 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the
        fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of
        Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the
        land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children,
        and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried
        away captive to Babylon;

040:008 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
        Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and
        Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the
        Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and
        their men.

040:009 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto
        them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the
        Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon,
        and it shall be well with you.

040:010 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
        Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine,
        and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and
        dwell in your cities that ye have taken.

040:011 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
        Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries,
        heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah,
        and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the
        son of Shaphan;

040:012 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were
        driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto
        Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.

040:013 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to
        Mizpah,

040:014 And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the
        king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
        to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them
        not.

040:015 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
        secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it:
        wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are
        gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in
        Judah perish?

040:016 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of
        Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest
        falsely of Ishmael.

041:001 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
        of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the
        princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah
        the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread
        together in Mizpah.

041:002 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that
        were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of
        Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon
        had made governor over the land.

041:003 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with
        Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there,
        and the men of war.

041:004 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain
        Gedaliah, and no man knew it,

041:005 That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from
        Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and
        their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings
        and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the
        LORD.

041:006 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to
        meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass,
        as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of
        Ahikam.

041:007 And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the
        midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.

041:008 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay
        us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of
        barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them
        not among their brethren.

041:009 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of
        the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which
        Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were
        slain.

041:010 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the
        people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all
        the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the
        captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of
        Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away
        captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

041:011 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,

041:012 Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the
        son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are
        in Gibeon.

041:013 Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with
        Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces that were with him, then they were glad.

041:014 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from
        Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son
        of Kareah.

041:015 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with
        eight men, and went to the Ammonites.

041:016 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people
        whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from
        Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
        even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and
        the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:

041:017 And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham,
        which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,

041:018 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them,
        because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the
        son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the
        land.

042:001 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
        Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people
        from the least even unto the greatest, came near,

042:002 And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
        supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the
        LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but
        a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)

042:003 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk,
        and the thing that we may do.

042:004 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;
        behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your
        words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the
        LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep
        nothing back from you.

042:005 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful
        witness between us, if we do not even according to all things
        for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.

042:006 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the
        voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may
        be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.

042:007 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD
        came unto Jeremiah.

042:008 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
        of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the
        least even to the greatest,

042:009 And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
        unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;

042:010 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you,
        and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you
        up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.

042:011 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid;
        be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to
        save you, and to deliver you from his hand.

042:012 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon
        you, and cause you to return to your own land.

042:013 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey
        the voice of the LORD your God,

042:014 Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we
        shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have
        hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:

042:015 And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of
        Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye
        wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn
        there;

042:016 Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared,
        shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine,
        whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in
        Egypt; and there ye shall die.

042:017 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go
        into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by
        the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall
        remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.

042:018 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine
        anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when
        ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and
        an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see
        this place no more.

042:019 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go
        ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you
        this day.

042:020 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the
        LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and
        according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare
        unto us, and we will do it.

042:021 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not
        obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the
        which he hath sent me unto you.

042:022 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword,
        by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye
        desire to go and to sojourn.

043:001 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of
        speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their
        God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even
        all these words,

043:002 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of
        Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou
        speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say,
        Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:

043:003 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for
        to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might
        put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.

043:004 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
        forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD,
        to dwell in the land of Judah.

043:005 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
        forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from
        all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the
        land of Judah;

043:006 Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters,
        and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had
        left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and
        Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.

043:007 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the
        voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.

043:008 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
        saying,

043:009 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in
        the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in
        Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;

043:010 And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
        Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king
        of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these
        stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion
        over them.

043:011 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and
        deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for
        captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the
        sword.

043:012 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt;
        and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he
        shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd
        putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in
        peace.

043:013 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the
        land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians
        shall he burn with fire.

044:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which
        dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at
        Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,

044:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen
        all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all
        the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a
        desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,

044:003 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to
        provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to
        serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor
        your fathers.

044:004 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
        early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable
        thing that I hate.

044:005 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from
        their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.

044:006 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was
        kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of
        Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.

044:007 Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God
        of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your
        souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling,
        out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;

044:008 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands,
        burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither
        ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and
        that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations
        of the earth?

044:009 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the
        wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their
        wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your
        wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in
        the streets of Jerusalem?

044:010 They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they
        feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set
        before you and before your fathers.

044:011 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut
        off all Judah.

044:012 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their
        faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they
        shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they
        shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they
        shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword
        and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an
        astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.

044:013 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I
        have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by
        the pestilence:

044:014 So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the
        land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that
        they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they
        have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return
        but such as shall escape.

044:015 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned
        incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a
        great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of
        Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,

044:016 As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of
        the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.

044:017 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of
        our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and
        to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and
        our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of
        Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty
        of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.

044:018 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
        and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all
        things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.

044:019 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured
        out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship
        her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?

044:020 Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the
        women, and to all the people which had given him that answer,
        saying,

044:021 The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the
        streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and
        your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD
        remember them, and came it not into his mind?

044:022 So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of
        your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have
        committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an
        astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this
        day.

044:023 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned
        against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD,
        nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his
        testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at
        this day.

044:024 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the
        women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the
        land of Egypt:

044:025 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye
        and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and
        fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our
        vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of
        heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will
        surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.

044:026 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell
        in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name,
        saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the
        mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying,
        The Lord GOD liveth.

044:027 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and
        all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be
        consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end
        of them.

044:028 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of
        the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant
        of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn
        there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.

044:029 And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will
        punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall
        surely stand against you for evil:

044:030 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of
        Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them
        that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the
        hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that
        sought his life.

045:001 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son
        of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the
        mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
        Josiah king of Judah, saying,

045:002 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:

045:003 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief
        to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

045:004 Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold,
        that which I have built will I break down, and that which I
        have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.

045:005 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for,
        behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but
        thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places
        whither thou goest.

046:001 The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet
        against the Gentiles;

046:002 Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt,
        which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of
        Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.

046:003 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.

046:004 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth
        with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the
        brigandines.

046:005 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and
        their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and
        look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.

046:006 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they
        shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river
        Euphrates.

046:007 Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved
        as the rivers?

046:008 Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like
        the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the
        earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.

046:009 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty
        men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle
        the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.

046:010 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of
        vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the
        sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk
        with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice
        in the north country by the river Euphrates.

046:011 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of
        Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt
        not be cured.

046:012 The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled
        the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty,
        and they are fallen both together.

046:013 The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land
        of Egypt.

046:014 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in
        Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee;
        for the sword shall devour round about thee.

046:015 Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because
        the LORD did drive them.

046:016 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they
        said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the
        land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.

046:017 They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he
        hath passed the time appointed.

046:018 As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
        Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the
        sea, so shall he come.

046:019 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into
        captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an
        inhabitant.

046:020 Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it
        cometh out of the north.

046:021 Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted
        bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away
        together: they did not stand, because the day of their
        calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.

046:022 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall
        march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers
        of wood.

046:023 They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it
        cannot be searched; because they are more than the
        grasshoppers, and are innumerable.

046:024 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be
        delivered into the hand of the people of the north.

046:025 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will
        punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their
        gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust
        in him:

046:026 And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their
        lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
        and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be
        inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.

046:027 But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O
        Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy
        seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return,
        and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.

046:028 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am
        with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations
        whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of
        thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee
        wholly unpunished.

047:001 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
        the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.

047:002 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
        and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the
        land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell
        therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of
        the land shall howl.

047:003 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong
        horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of
        his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children
        for feebleness of hands;

047:004 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines,
        and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that
        remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the
        remnant of the country of Caphtor.

047:005 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the
        remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?

047:006 O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be
        quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

047:007 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge
        against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he
        appointed it.

048:001 Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and
        taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.

048:002 There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
        devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from
        being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the
        sword shall pursue thee.

048:003 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great
        destruction.

048:004 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be
        heard.

048:005 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up;
        for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry
        of destruction.

048:006 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the
        wilderness.

048:007 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy
        treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go
        forth into captivity with his priests and his princes
        together.

048:008 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall
        escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be
        destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.

048:009 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the
        cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell
        therein.

048:010 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
        cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.

048:011 Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on
        his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
        neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste
        remained in him, and his scent is not changed.

048:012 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
        send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and
        shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.

048:013 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel
        was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.

048:014 How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?

048:015 Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen
        young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King,
        whose name is the LORD of hosts.

048:016 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction
        hasteth fast.

048:017 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know
        his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the
        beautiful rod!

048:018 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy
        glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come
        upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.

048:019 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him
        that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?

048:020 Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell
        ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,

048:021 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and
        upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

048:022 And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,

048:023 And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,

048:024 And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of
        the land of Moab, far or near.

048:025 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the
        LORD.

048:026 Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the
        LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall
        be in derision.

048:027 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among
        thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for
        joy.

048:028 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the
        rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides
        of the hole's mouth.

048:029 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
        loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the
        haughtiness of his heart.

048:030 I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his
        lies shall not so effect it.

048:031 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all
        Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

048:032 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of
        Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to
        the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits
        and upon thy vintage.

048:033 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and
        from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the
        winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting
        shall be no shouting.

048:034 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto
        Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto
        Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also
        of Nimrim shall be desolate.

048:035 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him
        that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense
        to his gods.

048:036 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine
        heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because
        the riches that he hath gotten are perished.

048:037 For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon
        all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

048:038 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
        Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like
        a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.

048:039 They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
        turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a
        dismaying to all them about him.

048:040 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and
        shall spread his wings over Moab.

048:041 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the
        mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart
        of a woman in her pangs.

048:042 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he
        hath magnified himself against the LORD.

048:043 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O
        inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.

048:044 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he
        that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare:
        for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their
        visitation, saith the LORD.

048:045 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of
        the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a
        flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of
        Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.

048:046 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for
        thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

048:047 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter
        days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

049:001 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no
        sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad,
        and his people dwell in his cities?

049:002 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
        cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites;
        and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be
        burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that
        were his heirs, saith the LORD.

049:003 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of
        Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by
        the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his
        priests and his princes together.

049:004 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
        backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying,
        Who shall come unto me?

049:005 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of
        hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be
        driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him
        that wandereth.

049:006 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children
        of Ammon, saith the LORD.

049:007 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no
        more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their
        wisdom vanished?

049:008 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I
        will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will
        visit him.

049:009 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some
        gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till
        they have enough.

049:010 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,
        and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled,
        and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.

049:011 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and
        let thy widows trust in me.

049:012 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not
        to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he
        that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go
        unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.

049:013 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall
        become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all
        the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.

049:014 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
        unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against
        her, and rise up to the battle.

049:015 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and
        despised among men.

049:016 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine
        heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that
        holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy
        nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence,
        saith the LORD.

049:017 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it
        shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues
        thereof.

049:018 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
        cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there,
        neither shall a son of man dwell in it.

049:019 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
        Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will
        suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man,
        that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will
        appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand
        before me?

049:020 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
        against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against
        the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall
        draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate
        with them.

049:021 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the
        noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.

049:022 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his
        wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the
        mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

049:023 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they
        have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is
        sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.

049:024 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and
        fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her,
        as a woman in travail.

049:025 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!

049:026 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the
        men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

049:027 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
        consume the palaces of Benhadad.

049:028 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the
        LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.

049:029 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall
        take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and
        their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every
        side.

049:030 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
        saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken
        counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.

049:031 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth
        without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor
        bars, which dwell alone.

049:032 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their
        cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that
        are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity
        from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.

049:033 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation
        for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man
        dwell in it.

049:034 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
        Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
        saying,

049:035 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of
        Elam, the chief of their might.

049:036 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four
        quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those
        winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of
        Elam shall not come.

049:037 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and
        before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon
        them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send
        the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

049:038 And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence
        the king and the princes, saith the LORD.

049:039 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will
        bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.

050:001 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the
        land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

050:002 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a
        standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel
        is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are
        confounded, her images are broken in pieces.

050:003 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her,
        which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell
        therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and
        beast.

050:004 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children
        of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together,
        going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

050:005 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
        saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a
        perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.

050:006 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused
        them to go astray, they have turned them away on the
        mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have
        forgotten their restingplace.

050:007 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries
        said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the
        LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of
        their fathers.

050:008 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the
        land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the
        flocks.

050:009 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
        assembly of great nations from the north country: and they
        shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she
        shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert
        man; none shall return in vain.

050:010 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
        satisfied, saith the LORD.

050:011 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of
        mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at
        grass, and bellow as bulls;

050:012 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall
        be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a
        wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.

050:013 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited,
        but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by
        Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

050:014 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye
        that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath
        sinned against the LORD.

050:015 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
        foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is
        the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she
        hath done, do unto her.

050:016 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the
        sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing
        sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall
        flee every one to his own land.

050:017 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away:
        first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.

050:018 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I
        have punished the king of Assyria.

050:019 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall
        feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied
        upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.

050:020 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity
        of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and
        the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will
        pardon them whom I reserve.

050:021 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and
        against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy
        after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I
        have commanded thee.

050:022 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.

050:023 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken!
        how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!

050:024 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O
        Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also
        caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.

050:025 The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the
        weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord
        GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

050:026 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses:
        cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of
        her be left.

050:027 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe
        unto them! for their day is come, the time of their
        visitation.

050:028 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of
        Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God,
        the vengeance of his temple.

050:029 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend
        the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape:
        recompense her according to her work; according to all that
        she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against
        the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.

050:030 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her
        men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.

050:031 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord
        GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit
        thee.

050:032 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall
        raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it
        shall devour all round about him.

050:033 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the
        children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took
        them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.

050:034 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he
        shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to
        the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.

050:035 A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the
        inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her
        wise men.

050:036 A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is
        upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.

050:037 A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and
        upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and
        they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and
        they shall be robbed.

050:038 A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for
        it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their
        idols.

050:039 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts
        of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell
        therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither
        shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.

050:040 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
        thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither
        shall any son of man dwell therein.

050:041 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great
        nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of
        the earth.

050:042 They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and
        will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and
        they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a
        man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.

050:043 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his
        hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of
        a woman in travail.

050:044 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
        Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them
        suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I
        may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint
        me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before
        me?

050:045 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
        against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed
        against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the
        flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their
        habitation desolate with them.

050:046 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and
        the cry is heard among the nations.

051:001 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,
        and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up
        against me, a destroying wind;

051:002 And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and
        shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be
        against her round about.

051:003 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and
        against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and
        spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.

051:004 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and
        they that are thrust through in her streets.

051:005 For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of
        the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin
        against the Holy One of Israel.

051:006 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his
        soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of
        the LORD's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.

051:007 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made
        all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine;
        therefore the nations are mad.

051:008 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take
        balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.

051:009 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake
        her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her
        judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the
        skies.

051:010 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let
        us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

051:011 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath
        raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device
        is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance
        of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.

051:012 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch
        strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the
        LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against
        the inhabitants of Babylon.

051:013 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures,
        thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.

051:014 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will
        fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift
        up a shout against thee.

051:015 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
        world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his
        understanding.

051:016 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
        the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the
        ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and
        bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

051:017 Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is
        confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is
        falsehood, and there is no breath in them.

051:018 They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their
        visitation they shall perish.

051:019 The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of
        all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD
        of hosts is his name.

051:020 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will
        I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy
        kingdoms;

051:021 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
        and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his
        rider;

051:022 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with
        thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will
        I break in pieces the young man and the maid;

051:023 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his
        flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and
        his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces
        captains and rulers.

051:024 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
        Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your
        sight, saith the LORD.

051:025 Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the
        LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out
        mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and
        will make thee a burnt mountain.

051:026 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a
        stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever,
        saith the LORD.

051:027 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the
        nations, prepare the nations against her, call together
        against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz;
        appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as
        the rough caterpillers.

051:028 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes,
        the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the
        land of his dominion.

051:029 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of
        the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land
        of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.

051:030 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have
        remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became
        as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are
        broken.

051:031 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet
        another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at
        one end,

051:032 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have
        burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.

051:033 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The
        daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to
        thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest
        shall come.

051:034 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath
        crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed
        me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my
        delicates, he hath cast me out.

051:035 The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall
        the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants
        of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.

051:036 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause,
        and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and
        make her springs dry.

051:037 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons,
        an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.

051:038 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions'
        whelps.

051:039 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them
        drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep,
        and not wake, saith the LORD.

051:040 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams
        with he goats.

051:041 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole
        earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among
        the nations!

051:042 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the
        multitude of the waves thereof.

051:043 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a
        land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass
        thereby.

051:044 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out
        of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations
        shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of
        Babylon shall fall.

051:045 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every
        man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.

051:046 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that
        shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year,
        and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and
        violence in the land, ruler against ruler.

051:047 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon
        the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be
        confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

051:048 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall
        sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from
        the north, saith the LORD.

051:049 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at
        Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.

051:050 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still:
        remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your
        mind.

051:051 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath
        covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries
        of the LORD's house.

051:052 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
        do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land
        the wounded shall groan.

051:053 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she
        should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall
        spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.

051:054 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction
        from the land of the Chaldeans:

051:055 Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of
        her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters,
        a noise of their voice is uttered:

051:056 Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and
        her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken:
        for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.

051:057 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her
        captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall
        sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose
        name is the LORD of hosts.

051:058 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall
        be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with
        fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the
        fire, and they shall be weary.

051:059 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son
        of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the
        king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign.
        And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.

051:060 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
        Babylon, even all these words that are written against
        Babylon.

051:061 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and
        shalt see, and shalt read all these words;

051:062 Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this
        place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither
        man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.

051:063 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this
        book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the
        midst of Euphrates:

051:064 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not
        rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall
        be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

052:001 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

052:002 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD,
        according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

052:003 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
        and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that
        Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

052:004 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
        tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army,
        against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts
        against it round about.

052:005 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
        Zedekiah.

052:006 And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the
        famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for
        the people of the land.

052:007 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and
        went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate
        between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now
        the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by
        the way of the plain.

052:008 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and
        overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army
        was scattered from him.

052:009 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of
        Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave
        judgment upon him.

052:010 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
        eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.

052:011 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
        bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him
        in prison till the day of his death.

052:012 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which
        was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
        came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king
        of Babylon, into Jerusalem,

052:013 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and
        all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great
        men, burned he with fire:

052:014 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain
        of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round
        about.

052:015 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
        certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the
        people that remained in the city, and those that fell away,
        that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the
        multitude.

052:016 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the
        poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

052:017 Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
        and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the
        LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them
        to Babylon.

052:018 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
        bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith
        they ministered, took they away.

052:019 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the
        caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups;
        that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver
        in silver, took the captain of the guard away.

052:020 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were
        under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of
        the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.

052:021 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was
        eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it;
        and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.

052:022 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one
        chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon
        the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar
        also and the pomegranates were like unto these.

052:023 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all
        the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.

052:024 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
        and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
        door:

052:025 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge
        of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the
        king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal
        scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and
        threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in
        the midst of the city.

052:026 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
        them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

052:027 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in
        Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away
        captive out of his own land.

052:028 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive:
        in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:

052:029 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away
        captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:

052:030 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan
        the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews
        seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were
        four thousand and six hundred.

052:031 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
        captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
        in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
        king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the
        head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of
        prison.

052:032 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne
        of the kings that were with him in Babylon,

052:033 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat
        bread before him all the days of his life.

052:034 And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the
        king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his
        death, all the days of his life.

Book 25	Lamentations

001:001 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how
        is she become as a widow! she that was great among the
        nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become
        tributary!

001:002 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her
        cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all
        her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become
        her enemies.

001:003 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and
        because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen,
        she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between
        the straits.

001:004 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn
        feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her
        virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.

001:005 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the
        LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her
        transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before
        the enemy.

001:006 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
        princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they
        are gone without strength before the pursuer.

001:007 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
        miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of
        old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none
        did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her
        sabbaths.

001:008 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed:
        all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
        nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.

001:009 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last
        end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no
        comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath
        magnified himself.

001:010 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
        things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her
        sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter
        into thy congregation.

001:011 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their
        pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and
        consider; for I am become vile.

001:012 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if
        there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto
        me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his
        fierce anger.

001:013 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth
        against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned
        me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.

001:014 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
        wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength
        to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from
        whom I am not able to rise up.

001:015 The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the
        midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my
        young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of
        Judah, as in a winepress.

001:016 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with
        water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is
        far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy
        prevailed.

001:017 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort
        her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his
        adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a
        menstruous woman among them.

001:018 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his
        commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my
        sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

001:019 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and
        mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought
        their meat to relieve their souls.

001:020 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;
        mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously
        rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as
        death.

001:021 They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all
        mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou
        hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,
        and they shall be like unto me.

001:022 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them,
        as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my
        sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

002:001 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in
        his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty
        of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his
        anger!

002:002 The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and
        hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong
        holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to
        the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes
        thereof.

002:003 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he
        hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he
        burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth
        round about.

002:004 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right
        hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the
        eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out
        his fury like fire.

002:005 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
        swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong
        holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning
        and lamentation.

002:006 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were
        of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the
        LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be
        forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his
        anger the king and the priest.

002:007 The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his
        sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the
        walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of
        the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.

002:008 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
        Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his
        hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the
        wall to lament; they languished together.

002:009 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and
        broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the
        Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision
        from the LORD.

002:010 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and
        keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they
        have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of
        Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.

002:011 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver
        is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter
        of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in
        the streets of the city.

002:012 They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they
        swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their
        soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.

002:013 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall
        I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal
        to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?
        for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?

002:014 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and
        they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy
        captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of
        banishment.

002:015 All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag
        their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the
        city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the
        whole earth?

002:016 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they
        hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up:
        certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found,
        we have seen it.

002:017 The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath
        fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old:
        he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused
        thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of
        thine adversaries.

002:018 Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of
        Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give
        thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.

002:019 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
        pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD:
        lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young
        children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.

002:020 Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.
        Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long?
        shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of
        the Lord?

002:021 The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my
        virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast
        slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and
        not pitied.

002:022 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so
        that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained:
        those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy
        consumed.

003:001 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his
        wrath.

003:002 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into
        light.

003:003 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me
        all the day.

003:004 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my
        bones.

003:005 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and
        travail.

003:006 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.

003:007 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made
        my chain heavy.

003:008 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

003:009 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my
        paths crooked.

003:010 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in
        secret places.

003:011 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath
        made me desolate.

003:012 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

003:013 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my
        reins.

003:014 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.

003:015 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken
        with wormwood.

003:016 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath
        covered me with ashes.

003:017 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
        prosperity.

003:018 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

003:019 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and
        the gall.

003:020 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

003:021 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

003:022 It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because
        his compassions fail not.

003:023 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

003:024 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope
        in him.

003:025 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
        seeketh him.

003:026 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for
        the salvation of the LORD.

003:027 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.

003:028 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it
        upon him.

003:029 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

003:030 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
        with reproach.

003:031 For the LORD will not cast off for ever:

003:032 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
        according to the multitude of his mercies.

003:033 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of
        men.

003:034 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.

003:035 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
        High,

003:036 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.

003:037 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
        commandeth it not?

003:038 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and
        good?

003:039 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment
        of his sins?

003:040 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.

003:041 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the
        heavens.

003:042 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not
        pardoned.

003:043 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast
        slain, thou hast not pitied.

003:044 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should
        not pass through.

003:045 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst
        of the people.

003:046 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

003:047 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

003:048 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction
        of the daughter of my people.

003:049 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any
        intermission.

003:050 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

003:051 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of
        my city.

003:052 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

003:053 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone
        upon me.

003:054 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.

003:055 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

003:056 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing,
        at my cry.

003:057 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou
        saidst, Fear not.

003:058 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
        redeemed my life.

003:059 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

003:060 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
        against me.

003:061 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their
        imaginations against me;

003:062 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device
        against me all the day.

003:063 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their
        musick.

003:064 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work
        of their hands.

003:065 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

003:066 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of
        the LORD.

004:001 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!
        the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every
        street.

004:002 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are
        they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of
        the potter!

004:003 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to
        their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel,
        like the ostriches in the wilderness.

004:004 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his
        mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man
        breaketh it unto them.

004:005 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:
        they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

004:006 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my
        people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,
        that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on
        her.

004:007 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than
        milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their
        polishing was of sapphire:

004:008 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the
        streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered,
        it is become like a stick.

004:009 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
        slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for
        want of the fruits of the field.

004:010 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
        they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my
        people.

004:011 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
        fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath
        devoured the foundations thereof.

004:012 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
        would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy
        should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.

004:013 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her
        priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of
        her,

004:014 They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have
        polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch
        their garments.

004:015 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart,
        depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said
        among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.

004:016 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more
        regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests,
        they favoured not the elders.

004:017 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
        watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.

004:018 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end
        is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

004:019 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:
        they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in
        the wilderness.

004:020 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was
        taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we
        shall live among the heathen.

004:021 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
        land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou
        shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.

004:022 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter
        of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he
        will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will
        discover thy sins.

005:001 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold
        our reproach.

005:002 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

005:003 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.

005:004 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.

005:005 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.

005:006 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians,
        to be satisfied with bread.

005:007 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
        iniquities.

005:008 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver
        us out of their hand.

005:009 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the
        sword of the wilderness.

005:010 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible
        famine.

005:011 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities
        of Judah.

005:012 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were
        not honoured.

005:013 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under
        the wood.

005:014 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
        musick.

005:015 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into
        mourning.

005:016 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have
        sinned!

005:017 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are
        dim.

005:018 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes
        walk upon it.

005:019 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation
        to generation.

005:020 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long
        time?

005:021 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew
        our days as of old.

005:022 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against
        us.

Book 26	Ezekiel

001:001 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth
        month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the
        captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened,
        and I saw visions of God.

001:002 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of
        king Jehoiachin's captivity,

001:003 The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,
        the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river
        Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.

001:004 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
        a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness
        was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of
        amber, out of the midst of the fire.

001:005 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
        creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the
        likeness of a man.

001:006 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.

001:007 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet
        was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the
        colour of burnished brass.

001:008 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their
        four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.

001:009 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when
        they went; they went every one straight forward.

001:010 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of
        a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they
        four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also
        had the face of an eagle.

001:011 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward;
        two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two
        covered their bodies.

001:012 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit
        was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

001:013 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance
        was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of
        lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the
        fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

001:014 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of
        a flash of lightning.

001:015 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon
        the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.

001:016 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the
        colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their
        appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle
        of a wheel.

001:017 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they
        turned not when they went.

001:018 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;
        and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.

001:019 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them:
        and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth,
        the wheels were lifted up.

001:020 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was
        their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against
        them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

001:021 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these
        stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the
        wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the
        living creature was in the wheels.

001:022 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
        creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched
        forth over their heads above.

001:023 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one
        toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this
        side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their
        bodies.

001:024 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the
        noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice
        of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let
        down their wings.

001:025 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their
        heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.

001:026 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the
        likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone:
        and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the
        appearance of a man above upon it.

001:027 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire
        round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even
        upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I
        saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness
        round about.

001:028 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day
        of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.
        This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the
        LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a
        voice of one that spake.

002:001 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I
        will speak unto thee.

002:002 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set
        me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.

002:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children
        of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against
        me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even
        unto this very day.

002:004 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send
        thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the
        Lord GOD.

002:005 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will
        forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know
        that there hath been a prophet among them.

002:006 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid
        of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and
        thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words,
        nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious
        house.

002:007 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will
        hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most
        rebellious.

002:008 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou
        rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat
        that I give thee.

002:009 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo,
        a roll of a book was therein;

002:010 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and
        without: and there was written therein lamentations, and
        mourning, and woe.

003:001 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest;
        eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.

003:002 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.

003:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and
        fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I
        eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

003:004 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house
        of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.

003:005 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of
        an hard language, but to the house of Israel;

003:006 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard
        language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I
        sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.

003:007 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they
        will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are
        impudent and hardhearted.

003:008 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and
        thy forehead strong against their foreheads.

003:009 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
        them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a
        rebellious house.

003:010 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I
        shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with
        thine ears.

003:011 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children
        of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith
        the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will
        forbear.

003:012 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a
        great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from
        his place.

003:013 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures
        that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over
        against them, and a noise of a great rushing.

003:014 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
        bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD
        was strong upon me.

003:015 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by
        the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained
        there astonished among them seven days.

003:016 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of
        the LORD came unto me, saying,

003:017 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of
        Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
        warning from me.

003:018 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou
        givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from
        his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall
        die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine
        hand.

003:019 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his
        wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his
        iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

003:020 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness,
        and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him,
        he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he
        shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done
        shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine
        hand.

003:021 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the
        righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live,
        because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

003:022 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto
        me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with
        thee.

003:023 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the
        glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the
        river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.

003:024 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and
        spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine
        house.

003:025 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon
        thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out
        among them:

003:026 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth,
        that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover:
        for they are a rebellious house.

003:027 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou
        shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth,
        let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for
        they are a rebellious house.

004:001 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before
        thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:

004:002 And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and
        cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set
        battering rams against it round about.

004:003 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a
        wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face
        against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege
        against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.

004:004 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the
        house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days
        that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.

004:005 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity,
        according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety
        days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

004:006 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right
        side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah
        forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.

004:007 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of
        Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt
        prophesy against it.

004:008 And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not
        turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the
        days of thy siege.

004:009 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and
        lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel,
        and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the
        days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and
        ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.

004:010 And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty
        shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.

004:011 Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an
        hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.

004:012 And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it
        with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.

004:013 And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat
        their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive
        them.

004:014 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been
        polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten
        of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither
        came there abominable flesh into my mouth.

004:015 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for
        man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.

004:016 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the
        staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by
        weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure,
        and with astonishment:

004:017 That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with
        another, and consume away for their iniquity.

005:001 And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
        barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon
        thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the
        hair.

005:002 Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the
        city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt
        take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a
        third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out
        a sword after them.

005:003 Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in
        thy skirts.

005:004 Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the
        fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come
        forth into all the house of Israel.

005:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in
        the midst of the nations and countries that are round about
        her.

005:006 And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than
        the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are
        round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my
        statutes, they have not walked in them.

005:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more
        than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked
        in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have
        done according to the judgments of the nations that are round
        about you;

005:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am
        against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee
        in the sight of the nations.

005:009 And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and
        whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all
        thine abominations.

005:010 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee,
        and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute
        judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I
        scatter into all the winds.

005:011 Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou
        hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and
        with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish
        thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any
        pity.

005:012 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with
        famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a
        third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I
        will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw
        out a sword after them.

005:013 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my
        fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they
        shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I
        have accomplished my fury in them.

005:014 Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the
        nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that
        pass by.

005:015 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
        astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when
        I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in
        furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.

005:016 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which
        shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to
        destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will
        break your staff of bread:

005:017 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall
        bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through
        thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have
        spoken it.

006:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

006:002 Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and
        prophesy against them,

006:003 And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
        GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the
        hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I,
        will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high
        places.

006:004 And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be
        broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.

006:005 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel
        before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about
        your altars.

006:006 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and
        the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be
        laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and
        cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be
        abolished.

006:007 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall
        know that I am the LORD.

006:008 Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall
        escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered
        through the countries.

006:009 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the
        nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am
        broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me,
        and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and
        they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have
        committed in all their abominations.

006:010 And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not
        said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.

006:011 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with
        thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the
        house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the
        famine, and by the pestilence.

006:012 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is
        near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is
        besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my
        fury upon them.

006:013 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men
        shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon
        every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under
        every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where
        they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.

006:014 So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land
        desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward
        Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

007:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

007:002 Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land
        of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of
        the land.

007:003 Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon
        thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will
        recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

007:004 And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity:
        but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine
        abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know
        that I am the LORD.

007:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is
        come.

007:006 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold,
        it is come.

007:007 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the
        land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not
        the sounding again of the mountains.

007:008 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish
        mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy
        ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.

007:009 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
        recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations
        that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the
        LORD that smiteth.

007:010 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
        the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

007:011 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them
        shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's:
        neither shall there be wailing for them.

007:012 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
        rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the
        multitude thereof.

007:013 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold,
        although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the
        whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall
        any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

007:014 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
        goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude
        thereof.

007:015 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine
        within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and
        he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour
        him.

007:016 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the
        mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning,
        every one for his iniquity.

007:017 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as
        water.

007:018 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror
        shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and
        baldness upon all their heads.

007:019 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold
        shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be
        able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they
        shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels:
        because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

007:020 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but
        they made the images of their abominations and of their
        detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from
        them.

007:021 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
        and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall
        pollute it.

007:022 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my
        secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile
        it.

007:023 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the
        city is full of violence.

007:024 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they
        shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the
        strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

007:025 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall
        be none.

007:026 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon
        rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the
        law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the
        ancients.

007:027 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with
        desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be
        troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according
        to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

008:001 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in
        the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the
        elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD
        fell there upon me.

008:002 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire:
        from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from
        his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the
        colour of amber.

008:003 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
        mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and
        the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem,
        to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north;
        where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh
        to jealousy.

008:004 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there,
        according to the vision that I saw in the plain.

008:005 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the
        way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward
        the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this
        image of jealousy in the entry.

008:006 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they
        do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel
        committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary?
        but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater
        abominations.

008:007 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
        behold a hole in the wall.

008:008 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and
        when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.

008:009 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations
        that they do here.

008:010 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping
        things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house
        of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.

008:011 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the
        house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the
        son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a
        thick cloud of incense went up.

008:012 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
        ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in
        the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us
        not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.

008:013 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
        greater abominations that they do.

008:014 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house
        which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women
        weeping for Tammuz.

008:015 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn
        thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than
        these.

008:016 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house,
        and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between
        the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with
        their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces
        toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.

008:017 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it
        a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the
        abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the
        land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger:
        and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.

008:018 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,
        neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears
        with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.

009:001 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause
        them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every
        man with his destroying weapon in his hand.

009:002 And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate,
        which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon
        in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen,
        with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and
        stood beside the brasen altar.

009:003 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the
        cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And
        he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the
        writer's inkhorn by his side;

009:004 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,
        through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the
        foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the
        abominations that be done in the midst thereof.

009:005 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him
        through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither
        have ye pity:

009:006 Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children,
        and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark;
        and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men
        which were before the house.

009:007 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts
        with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in
        the city.

009:008 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was
        left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord
        GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy
        pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?

009:009 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and
        Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and
        the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath
        forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.

009:010 And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I
        have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.

009:011 And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn
        by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou
        hast commanded me.

010:001 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above
        the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were
        a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a
        throne.

010:002 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
        between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand
        with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter
        them over the city. And he went in in my sight.

010:003 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when
        the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

010:004 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood
        over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with
        the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the
        LORD's glory.

010:005 And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the
        outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he
        speaketh.

010:006 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man
        clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels,
        from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside
        the wheels.

010:007 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
        cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and
        took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was
        clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.

010:008 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand
        under their wings.

010:009 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims,
        one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub:
        and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl
        stone.

010:010 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as
        if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.

010:011 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned
        not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked
        they followed it; they turned not as they went.

010:012 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
        their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about,
        even the wheels that they four had.

010:013 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
        wheel.

010:014 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
        cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the
        third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

010:015 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
        that I saw by the river of Chebar.

010:016 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
        the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the
        earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.

010:017 When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,
        these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living
        creature was in them.

010:018 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
        the house, and stood over the cherubims.

010:019 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from
        the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also
        were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east
        gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel
        was over them above.

010:020 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
        by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the
        cherubims.

010:021 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and
        the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

010:022 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
        by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they
        went every one straight forward.

011:001 Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east
        gate of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold
        at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw
        Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah,
        princes of the people.

011:002 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that
        devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:

011:003 Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is
        the caldron, and we be the flesh.

011:004 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.

011:005 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me,
        Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of
        Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every
        one of them.

011:006 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled
        the streets thereof with the slain.

011:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have
        laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is
        the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of
        it.

011:008 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,
        saith the Lord GOD.

011:009 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you
        into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among
        you.

011:010 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of
        Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

011:011 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the
        flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border
        of Israel:

011:012 And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked
        in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done
        after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.

011:013 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son
        of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with
        a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end
        of the remnant of Israel?

011:014 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

011:015 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy
        kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto
        whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from
        the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.

011:016 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast
        them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered
        them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little
        sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.

011:017 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you
        from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where
        ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of
        Israel.

011:018 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the
        detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof
        from thence.

011:019 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit
        within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their
        flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:

011:020 That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances,
        and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
        God.

011:021 But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
        detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense
        their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.

011:022 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels
        beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them
        above.

011:023 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,
        and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the
        city.

011:024 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision
        by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
        So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

011:025 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that
        the LORD had shewed me.

012:001 The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,

012:002 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house,
        which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear,
        and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.

012:003 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing,
        and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from
        thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will
        consider, though they be a rebellious house.

012:004 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight,
        as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in
        their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.

012:005 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out
        thereby.

012:006 In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and
        carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face,
        that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign
        unto the house of Israel.

012:007 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by
        day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through
        the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight,
        and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.

012:008 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

012:009 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious
        house, said unto thee, What doest thou?

012:010 Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden
        concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of
        Israel that are among them.

012:011 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done
        unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.

012:012 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
        in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through
        the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that
        he see not the ground with his eyes.

012:013 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in
        my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the
        Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.

012:014 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
        help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword
        after them.

012:015 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter
        them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

012:016 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
        famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all
        their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and
        they shall know that I am the LORD.

012:017 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

012:018 Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water
        with trembling and with carefulness;

012:019 And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD
        of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel;
        They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their
        water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from
        all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that
        dwell therein.

012:020 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the
        land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

012:021 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

012:022 Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of
        Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision
        faileth?

012:023 Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this
        proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb
        in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the
        effect of every vision.

012:024 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering
        divination within the house of Israel.

012:025 For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall
        speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for
        in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and
        will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.

012:026 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.

012:027 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The
        vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he
        prophesieth of the times that are far off.

012:028 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall
        none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I
        have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.

013:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

013:002 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that
        prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their
        own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;

013:003 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that
        follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

013:004 O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

013:005 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge
        for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of
        the LORD.

013:006 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD
        saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made
        others to hope that they would confirm the word.

013:007 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
        divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have
        not spoken?

013:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken
        vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,
        saith the Lord GOD.

013:009 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
        that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my
        people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the
        house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of
        Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

013:010 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,
        Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and,
        lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:

013:011 Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it
        shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O
        great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.

013:012 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,
        Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?

013:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a
        stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing
        shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to
        consume it.

013:014 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
        untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that
        the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall,
        and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall
        know that I am the LORD.

013:015 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
        that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto
        you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;

013:016 To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning
        Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there
        is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.

013:017 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters
        of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and
        prophesy thou against them,

013:018 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew
        pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of
        every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my
        people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?

013:019 And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley
        and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not
        die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your
        lying to my people that hear your lies?

013:020 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your
        pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly,
        and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls
        go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.

013:021 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
        your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be
        hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

013:022 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,
        whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the
        wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by
        promising him life:

013:023 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:
        for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall
        know that I am the LORD.

014:001 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat
        before me.

014:002 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

014:003 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart,
        and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their
        face: should I be enquired of at all by them?

014:004 Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the
        Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his
        idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his
        iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the
        LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of
        his idols;

014:005 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart,
        because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

014:006 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
        GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn
        away your faces from all your abominations.

014:007 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
        sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and
        setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the
        stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to
        a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will
        answer him by myself:

014:008 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a
        sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of
        my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

014:009 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I
        the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my
        hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my
        people Israel.

014:010 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
        punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of
        him that seeketh unto him;

014:011 That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me,
        neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions;
        but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith
        the Lord GOD.

014:012 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

014:013 Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing
        grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and
        will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send
        famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:

014:014 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it,
        they should deliver but their own souls by their
        righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.

014:015 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they
        spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through
        because of the beasts:

014:016 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
        GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only
        shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

014:017 Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go
        through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:

014:018 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
        GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they
        only shall be delivered themselves.

014:019 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury
        upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:

014:020 Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the
        Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they
        shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

014:021 For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four
        sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and
        the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man
        and beast?

014:022 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
        brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall
        come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their
        doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I
        have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have
        brought upon it.

014:023 And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
        doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause
        all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

015:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

015:002 Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than
        a branch which is among the trees of the forest?

015:003 Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a
        pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

015:004 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
        both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet
        for any work?

015:005 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much
        less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath
        devoured it, and it is burned?

015:006 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the
        trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel,
        so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

015:007 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from
        one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall
        know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.

015:008 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed
        a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.

016:001 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

016:002 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

016:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and
        thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an
        Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.

016:004 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel
        was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee;
        thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

016:005 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
        compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open
        field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast
        born.

016:006 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
        blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live;
        yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.

016:007 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and
        thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to
        excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair
        is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.

016:008 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy
        time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee,
        and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered
        into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou
        becamest mine.

016:009 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away
        thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

016:010 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
        badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I
        covered thee with silk.

016:011 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon
        thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.

016:012 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,
        and a beautiful crown upon thine head.

016:013 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment
        was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst
        eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding
        beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.

016:014 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty:
        for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon
        thee, saith the Lord GOD.

016:015 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
        harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy
        fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.

016:016 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
        places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon:
        the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.

016:017 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
        silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images
        of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,

016:018 And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and
        thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.

016:019 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and
        honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them
        for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.

016:020 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou
        hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them
        to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,

016:021 That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause
        them to pass through the fire for them?

016:022 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not
        remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and
        bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.

016:023 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto
        thee! saith the LORD GOD;)

016:024 That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast
        made thee an high place in every street.

016:025 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and
        hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet
        to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.

016:026 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
        neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms,
        to provoke me to anger.

016:027 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and
        have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto
        the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the
        Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.

016:028 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because
        thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with
        them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.

016:029 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
        Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied
        therewith.

016:030 How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest
        all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;

016:031 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every
        way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not
        been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;

016:032 But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers
        instead of her husband!

016:033 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to
        all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee
        on every side for thy whoredom.

016:034 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
        whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that
        thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee,
        therefore thou art contrary.

016:035 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:

016:036 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured
        out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with
        thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by
        the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;

016:037 Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou
        hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with
        all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round
        about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them,
        that they may see all thy nakedness.

016:038 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
        blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and
        jealousy.

016:039 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall
        throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high
        places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall
        take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.

016:040 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they
        shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with
        their swords.

016:041 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute
        judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will
        cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also
        shalt give no hire any more.

016:042 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
        shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no
        more angry.

016:043 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but
        hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also
        will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD:
        and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine
        abominations.

016:044 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
        against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

016:045 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and
        her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which
        lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an
        Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

016:046 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
        dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth
        at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

016:047 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after
        their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing,
        thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.

016:048 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,
        she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy
        daughters.

016:049 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
        fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in
        her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor
        and needy.

016:050 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
        therefore I took them away as I saw good.

016:051 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
        multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast
        justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou
        hast done.

016:052 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
        for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than
        they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou
        confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast
        justified thy sisters.

016:053 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of
        Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her
        daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy
        captives in the midst of them:

016:054 That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be
        confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a
        comfort unto them.

016:055 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to
        their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall
        return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters
        shall return to your former estate.

016:056 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
        of thy pride,

016:057 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy
        reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round
        about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise
        thee round about.

016:058 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
        LORD.

016:059 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as
        thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the
        covenant.

016:060 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
        of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting
        covenant.

016:061 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
        shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I
        will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy
        covenant.

016:062 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt
        know that I am the LORD:

016:063 That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open
        thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified
        toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.

017:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

017:002 Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the
        house of Israel;

017:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great
        wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours,
        came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:

017:004 He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into
        a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.

017:005 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a
        fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a
        willow tree.

017:006 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
        branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under
        him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot
        forth sprigs.

017:007 There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
        feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward
        him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might
        water it by the furrows of her plantation.

017:008 It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might
        bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it
        might be a goodly vine.

017:009 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he
        not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof,
        that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her
        spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up
        by the roots thereof.

017:010 Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
        utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall
        wither in the furrows where it grew.

017:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

017:012 Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things
        mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to
        Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes
        thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;

017:013 And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with
        him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the
        mighty of the land:

017:014 That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself
        up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.

017:015 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
        Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall
        he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall
        he break the covenant, and be delivered?

017:016 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the
        king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and
        whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon
        he shall die.

017:017 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
        make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building
        forts, to cut off many persons:

017:018 Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when,
        lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he
        shall not escape.

017:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath
        that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken,
        even it will I recompense upon his own head.

017:020 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
        snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with
        him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.

017:021 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
        sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all
        winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.

017:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest
        branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off
        from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant
        it upon an high mountain and eminent:

017:023 In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and
        it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly
        cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the
        shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.

017:024 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have
        brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have
        dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to
        flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.

018:001 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

018:002 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of
        Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the
        children's teeth are set on edge?

018:003 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any
        more to use this proverb in Israel.

018:004 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also
        the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall
        die.

018:005 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,

018:006 And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up
        his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath
        defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a
        menstruous woman,

018:007 And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor
        his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his
        bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a
        garment;

018:008 He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken
        any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath
        executed true judgment between man and man,

018:009 Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to
        deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord
        GOD.

018:010 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and
        that doeth the like to any one of these things,

018:011 And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten
        upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,

018:012 Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence,
        hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to
        the idols, hath committed abomination,

018:013 Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he
        then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these
        abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon
        him.

018:014 Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins
        which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,

018:015 That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up
        his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled
        his neighbour's wife,

018:016 Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge,
        neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to
        the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,

018:017 That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not
        received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath
        walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of
        his father, he shall surely live.

018:018 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
        brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his
        people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.

018:019 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
        father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right,
        and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall
        surely live.

018:020 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear
        the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the
        iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall
        be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon
        him.

018:021 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
        committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is
        lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

018:022 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not
        be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done
        he shall live.

018:023 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith
        the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and
        live?

018:024 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,
        and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the
        abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his
        righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his
        trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath
        sinned, in them shall he die.

018:025 Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O
        house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways
        unequal?

018:026 When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and
        committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that
        he hath done shall he die.

018:027 Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness
        that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and
        right, he shall save his soul alive.

018:028 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his
        transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live,
        he shall not die.

018:029 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not
        equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your
        ways unequal?

018:030 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one
        according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn
        yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not
        be your ruin.

018:031 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
        transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for
        why will ye die, O house of Israel?

018:032 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith
        the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

019:001 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

019:002 And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among
        lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.

019:003 And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion,
        and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.

019:004 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and
        they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.

019:005 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost,
        then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young
        lion.

019:006 And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young
        lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.

019:007 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their
        cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by
        the noise of his roaring.

019:008 Then the nations set against him on every side from the
        provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in
        their pit.

019:009 And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the
        king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice
        should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.

019:010 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:
        she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many
        waters.

019:011 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare
        rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches,
        and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her
        branches.

019:012 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the
        ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods
        were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.

019:013 And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
        ground.

019:014 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath
        devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a
        sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a
        lamentation.

020:001 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month,
        the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of
        Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.

020:002 Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

020:003 Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto
        them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me?
        As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by
        you.

020:004 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause
        them to know the abominations of their fathers:

020:005 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I
        chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the
        house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of
        Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the
        LORD your God;

020:006 In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them
        forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for
        them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all
        lands:

020:007 Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations
        of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of
        Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

020:008 But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me:
        they did not every man cast away the abominations of their
        eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I
        said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my
        anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

020:009 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
        polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose
        sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth
        out of the land of Egypt.

020:010 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
        and brought them into the wilderness.

020:011 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments,
        which if a man do, he shall even live in them.

020:012 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me
        and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that
        sanctify them.

020:013 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
        they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my
        judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and
        my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour
        out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.

020:014 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
        polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them
        out.

020:015 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that
        I would not bring them into the land which I had given them,
        flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

020:016 Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my
        statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after
        their idols.

020:017 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them,
        neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

020:018 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not
        in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their
        judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:

020:019 I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my
        judgments, and do them;

020:020 And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me
        and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.

020:021 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked
        not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them,
        which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted
        my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them,
        to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

020:022 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's
        sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the
        heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.

020:023 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I
        would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them
        through the countries;

020:024 Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised
        my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were
        after their fathers' idols.

020:025 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
        judgments whereby they should not live;

020:026 And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to
        pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might
        make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am
        the LORD.

020:027 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say
        unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers
        have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass
        against me.

020:028 For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I
        lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every
        high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there
        their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of
        their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and
        poured out there their drink offerings.

020:029 Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?
        And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.

020:030 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
        GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and
        commit ye whoredom after their abominations?

020:031 For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass
        through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols,
        even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house
        of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be
        enquired of by you.

020:032 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that
        ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the
        countries, to serve wood and stone.

020:033 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and
        with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I
        rule over you:

020:034 And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you
        out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty
        hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

020:035 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and
        there will I plead with you face to face.

020:036 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
        land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

020:037 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring
        you into the bond of the covenant:

020:038 And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that
        transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the
        country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the
        land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

020:039 As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,
        serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will
        not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with
        your gifts, and with your idols.

020:040 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of
        Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of
        Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept
        them, and there will I require your offerings, and the
        firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.

020:041 I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out
        from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein
        ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before
        the heathen.

020:042 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you
        into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I
        lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.

020:043 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
        wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in
        your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.

020:044 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with
        you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor
        according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith
        the Lord GOD.

020:045 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

020:046 Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word
        toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south
        field;

020:047 And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD;
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee,
        and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry
        tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces
        from the south to the north shall be burned therein.

020:048 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it
        shall not be quenched.

020:049 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak
        parables?

021:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

021:002 Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word
        toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of
        Israel,

021:003 And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I
        am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his
        sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the
        wicked.

021:004 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and
        the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his
        sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

021:005 That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my
        sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.

021:006 Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy
        loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.

021:007 And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest
        thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it
        cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be
        feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be
        weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to
        pass, saith the Lord GOD.

021:008 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

021:009 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A
        sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:

021:010 It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that
        it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the
        rod of my son, as every tree.

021:011 And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled:
        this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into
        the hand of the slayer.

021:012 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it
        shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of
        the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy
        thigh.

021:013 Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the
        rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.

021:014 Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands
        together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the
        sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are
        slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.

021:015 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates,
        that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah!
        it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.

021:016 Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the
        left, whithersoever thy face is set.

021:017 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my
        fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.

021:018 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

021:019 Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword
        of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth
        out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the
        head of the way to the city.

021:020 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
        Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.

021:021 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at
        the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his
        arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the
        liver.

021:022 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint
        captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the
        voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the
        gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.

021:023 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their
        sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to
        remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.

021:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
        iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are
        discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear;
        because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be
        taken with the hand.

021:025 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,
        when iniquity shall have an end,

021:026 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the
        crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and
        abase him that is high.

021:027 I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no
        more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.

021:028 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord
        GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach;
        even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the
        slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the
        glittering:

021:029 Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie
        unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are
        slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity
        shall have an end.

021:030 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee
        in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy
        nativity.

021:031 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow
        against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into
        the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.

021:032 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the
        midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the
        LORD have spoken it.

022:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

022:002 Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the
        bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.

022:003 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth
        blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh
        idols against herself to defile herself.

022:004 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and
        hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and
        thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto
        thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the
        heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

022:005 Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall
        mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.

022:006 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their
        power to shed blood.

022:007 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst
        of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in
        thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.

022:008 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my
        sabbaths.

022:009 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee
        they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit
        lewdness.

022:010 In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee
        have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

022:011 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife;
        and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and
        another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's
        daughter.

022:012 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken
        usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy
        neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord
        GOD.

022:013 Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest
        gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in
        the midst of thee.

022:014 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the
        days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it,
        and will do it.

022:015 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee
        in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

022:016 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight
        of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

022:017 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

022:018 Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all
        they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of
        the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.

022:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become
        dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of
        Jerusalem.

022:020 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
        into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to
        melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury,
        and I will leave you there, and melt you.

022:021 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
        wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.

022:022 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye
        be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the
        LORD have poured out my fury upon you.

022:023 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

022:024 Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not
        cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

022:025 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof,
        like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured
        souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they
        have made her many widows in the midst thereof.

022:026 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
        things: they have put no difference between the holy and
        profane, neither have they shewed difference between the
        unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my
        sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

022:027 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the
        prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest
        gain.

022:028 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter,
        seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith
        the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.

022:029 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
        robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have
        oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

022:030 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
        hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I
        should not destroy it: but I found none.

022:031 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
        consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I
        recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.

023:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

023:002 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:

023:003 And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed
        whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed,
        and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.

023:004 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
        sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters.
        Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem
        Aholibah.

023:005 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted
        on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,

023:006 Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them
        desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

023:007 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
        were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she
        doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.

023:008 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her
        youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her
        virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.

023:009 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers,
        into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

023:010 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
        daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous
        among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

023:011 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in
        her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than
        her sister in her whoredoms.

023:012 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and
        rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses,
        all of them desirable young men.

023:013 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,

023:014 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
        pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans
        pourtrayed with vermilion,

023:015 Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire
        upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the
        manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their
        nativity:

023:016 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon
        them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.

023:017 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
        defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with
        them, and her mind was alienated from them.

023:018 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
        then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was
        alienated from her sister.

023:019 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance
        the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in
        the land of Egypt.

023:020 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the
        flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

023:021 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth,
        in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy
        youth.

023:022 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
        raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is
        alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;

023:023 The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and
        Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable
        young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all
        of them riding upon horses.

023:024 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and
        wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set
        against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I
        will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee
        according to their judgments.

023:025 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
        furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine
        ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take
        thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured
        by the fire.

023:026 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away
        thy fair jewels.

023:027 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
        whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt
        not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.

023:028 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into
        the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from
        whom thy mind is alienated:

023:029 And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away
        all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the
        nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy
        lewdness and thy whoredoms.

023:030 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a
        whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with
        their idols.

023:031 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I
        give her cup into thine hand.

023:032 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup
        deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in
        derision; it containeth much.

023:033 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup
        of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister
        Samaria.

023:034 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break
        the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I
        have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

023:035 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten
        me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy
        lewdness and thy whoredoms.

023:036 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
        Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their
        abominations;

023:037 That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their
        hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and
        have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass
        for them through the fire, to devour them.

023:038 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my
        sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

023:039 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then
        they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and,
        lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.

023:040 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
        unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom
        thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst
        thyself with ornaments,

023:041 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it,
        whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.

023:042 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and
        with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the
        wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and
        beautiful crowns upon their heads.

023:043 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now
        commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?

023:044 Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that
        playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto
        Aholibah, the lewd women.

023:045 And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner
        of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed
        blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their
        hands.

023:046 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon
        them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.

023:047 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch
        them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their
        daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

023:048 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
        women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.

023:049 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall
        bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the
        Lord GOD.

024:001 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day
        of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

024:002 Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same
        day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this
        same day.

024:003 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto
        them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and
        also pour water into it:

024:004 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the
        thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

024:005 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under
        it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it
        therein.

024:006 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to
        the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out
        of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

024:007 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top
        of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with
        dust;

024:008 That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have
        set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be
        covered.

024:009 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I
        will even make the pile for fire great.

024:010 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it
        well, and let the bones be burned.

024:011 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it
        may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be
        molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.

024:012 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went
        not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.

024:013 In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and
        thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy
        filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon
        thee.

024:014 I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will
        do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will
        I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings,
        shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.

024:015 Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

024:016 Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine
        eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep,
        neither shall thy tears run down.

024:017 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire
        of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet,
        and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.

024:018 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife
        died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

024:019 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these
        things are to us, that thou doest so?

024:020 Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me,
        saying,

024:021 Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
        Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your
        strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul
        pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left
        shall fall by the sword.

024:022 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips,
        nor eat the bread of men.

024:023 And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon
        your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away
        for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.

024:024 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath
        done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I
        am the Lord GOD.

024:025 Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take
        from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire
        of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their
        sons and their daughters,

024:026 That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to
        cause thee to hear it with thine ears?

024:027 In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped,
        and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a
        sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

025:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

025:002 Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy
        against them;

025:003 And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD;
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my
        sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of
        Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah,
        when they went into captivity;

025:004 Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east
        for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee,
        and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit,
        and they shall drink thy milk.

025:005 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites
        a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the
        LORD.

025:006 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine
        hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with
        all thy despite against the land of Israel;

025:007 Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and
        will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut
        thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out
        of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know
        that I am the LORD.

025:008 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
        Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;

025:009 Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the
        cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory
        of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,

025:010 Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give
        them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered
        among the nations.

025:011 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know
        that I am the LORD.

025:012 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against
        the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly
        offended, and revenged himself upon them;

025:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out
        mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it;
        and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan
        shall fall by the sword.

025:014 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
        Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and
        according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith
        the Lord GOD.

025:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by
        revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to
        destroy it for the old hatred;

025:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out
        mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the
        Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

025:017 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
        rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall
        lay my vengeance upon them.

026:001 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of
        the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

026:002 Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem,
        Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is
        turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:

026:003 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee,
        O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee,
        as the sea causeth his waves to come up.

026:004 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
        towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her
        like the top of a rock.

026:005 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of
        the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it
        shall become a spoil to the nations.

026:006 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
        sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

026:007 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the
        north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and
        companies, and much people.

026:008 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and
        he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against
        thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.

026:009 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with
        his axes he shall break down thy towers.

026:010 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall
        cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the
        horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he
        shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein
        is made a breach.

026:011 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
        streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong
        garrisons shall go down to the ground.

026:012 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of
        thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and
        destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and
        thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.

026:013 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the
        sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.

026:014 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a
        place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I
        the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

026:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at
        the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the
        slaughter is made in the midst of thee?

026:016 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their
        thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered
        garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they
        shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment,
        and be astonished at thee.

026:017 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to
        thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring
        men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and
        her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that
        haunt it!

026:018 Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the
        isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.

026:019 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate
        city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall
        bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover
        thee;

026:020 When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the
        pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the
        low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them
        that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I
        shall set glory in the land of the living;

026:021 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though
        thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith
        the Lord GOD.

027:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

027:002 Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;

027:003 And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of
        the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles,
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of
        perfect beauty.

027:004 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
        perfected thy beauty.

027:005 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they
        have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

027:006 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company
        of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out
        of the isles of Chittim.

027:007 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
        spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles
        of Elishah was that which covered thee.

027:008 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise
        men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.

027:009 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee
        thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were
        in thee to occupy thy merchandise.

027:010 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy
        men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they
        set forth thy comeliness.

027:011 The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round
        about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their
        shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty
        perfect.

027:012 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all
        kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded
        in thy fairs.

027:013 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they
        traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.

027:014 They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses
        and horsemen and mules.

027:015 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the
        merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present
        horns of ivory and ebony.

027:016 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares
        of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds,
        purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and
        agate.

027:017 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they
        traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey,
        and oil, and balm.

027:018 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy
        making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of
        Helbon, and white wool.

027:019 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:
        bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.

027:020 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.

027:021 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee
        in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy
        merchants.

027:022 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants:
        they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with
        all precious stones, and gold.

027:023 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur,
        and Chilmad, were thy merchants.

027:024 These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue
        clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel,
        bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

027:025 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou
        wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the
        seas.

027:026 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind
        hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.

027:027 Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and
        thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise,
        and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy
        company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the
        midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

027:028 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.

027:029 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots
        of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand
        upon the land;

027:030 And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and
        shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads,
        they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:

027:031 And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird
        them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with
        bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.

027:032 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for
        thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus,
        like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?

027:033 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many
        people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the
        multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.

027:034 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the
        depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in
        the midst of thee shall fall.

027:035 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,
        and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled
        in their countenance.

027:036 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt
        be a terror, and never shalt be any more.

028:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

028:002 Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord
        GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I
        am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas;
        yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart
        as the heart of God:

028:003 Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that
        they can hide from thee:

028:004 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
        thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy
        treasures:

028:005 By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased
        thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy
        riches:

028:006 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine
        heart as the heart of God;

028:007 Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the
        terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords
        against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy
        brightness.

028:008 They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the
        deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.

028:009 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but
        thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that
        slayeth thee.

028:010 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
        strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

028:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

028:012 Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and
        say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the
        sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

028:013 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone
        was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the
        beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald,
        and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets
        and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou
        wast created.

028:014 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set
        thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast
        walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

028:015 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
        created, till iniquity was found in thee.

028:016 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
        of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will
        cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will
        destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones
        of fire.

028:017 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
        corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast
        thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they
        may behold thee.

028:018 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
        iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I
        bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour
        thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the
        sight of all them that behold thee.

028:019 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished
        at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any
        more.

028:020 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

028:021 Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against
        it,

028:022 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
        Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they
        shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed
        judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.

028:023 For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her
        streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her
        by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that
        I am the LORD.

028:024 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
        Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about
        them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the
        Lord GOD.

028:025 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house
        of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and
        shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then
        shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant
        Jacob.

028:026 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses,
        and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence,
        when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise
        them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD
        their God.

029:001 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of
        the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

029:002 Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
        prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:

029:003 Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against
        thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in
        the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine
        own, and I have made it for myself.

029:004 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of
        thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up
        out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers
        shall stick unto thy scales.

029:005 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all
        the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields;
        thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given
        thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of
        the heaven.

029:006 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the
        LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of
        Israel.

029:007 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and
        rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou
        brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.

029:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a
        sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.

029:009 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they
        shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river
        is mine, and I have made it.

029:010 Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers,
        and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate,
        from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

029:011 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall
        pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

029:012 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
        countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities
        that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will
        scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse
        them through the countries.

029:013 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I
        gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were
        scattered:

029:014 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause
        them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of
        their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.

029:015 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt
        itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them,
        that they shall no more rule over the nations.

029:016 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
        which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall
        look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

029:017 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the
        first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the
        LORD came unto me, saying,

029:018 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to
        serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald,
        and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his
        army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against
        it:

029:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the
        land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he
        shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her
        prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.

029:020 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he
        served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord
        GOD.

029:021 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to
        bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in
        the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

030:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

030:002 Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl
        ye, Woe worth the day!

030:003 For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a
        cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.

030:004 And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be
        in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they
        shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be
        broken down.

030:005 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people,
        and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall
        fall with them by the sword.

030:006 Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall;
        and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of
        Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.

030:007 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that
        are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the
        cities that are wasted.

030:008 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire
        in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.

030:009 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make
        the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon
        them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.

030:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of
        Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

030:011 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall
        be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their
        swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

030:012 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the
        hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all
        that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have
        spoken it.

030:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I
        will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall
        be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a
        fear in the land of Egypt.

030:014 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan,
        and will execute judgments in No.

030:015 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I
        will cut off the multitude of No.

030:016 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and
        No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses
        daily.

030:017 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:
        and these cities shall go into captivity.

030:018 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall
        break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength
        shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and
        her daughters shall go into captivity.

030:019 Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know
        that I am the LORD.

030:020 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month,
        in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD
        came unto me, saying,

030:021 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
        and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a
        roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

030:022 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against
        Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong,
        and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall
        out of his hand.

030:023 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
        disperse them through the countries.

030:024 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
        my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he
        shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded
        man.

030:025 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the
        arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am
        the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king
        of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of
        Egypt.

030:026 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and
        disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

031:001 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month,
        in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came
        unto me, saying,

031:002 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his
        multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?

031:003 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair
        branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature;
        and his top was among the thick boughs.

031:004 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with
        her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little
        rivers unto all the trees of the field.

031:005 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
        field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became
        long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.

031:006 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and
        under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth
        their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.

031:007 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his
        branches: for his root was by great waters.

031:008 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir
        trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were
        not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was
        like unto him in his beauty.

031:009 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that
        all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied
        him.

031:010 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
        thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick
        boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;

031:011 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one
        of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven
        him out for his wickedness.

031:012 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
        and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys
        his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the
        rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone
        down from his shadow, and have left him.

031:013 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and
        all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:

031:014 To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt
        themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among
        the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their
        height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto
        death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the
        children of men, with them that go down to the pit.

031:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the
        grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I
        restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were
        stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the
        trees of the field fainted for him.

031:016 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
        cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and
        all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all
        that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of
        the earth.

031:017 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
        with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under
        his shadow in the midst of the heathen.

031:018 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
        trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees
        of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in
        the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the
        sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord
        GOD.

032:001 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,
        in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came
        unto me, saying,

032:002 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt,
        and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations,
        and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth
        with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and
        fouledst their rivers.

032:003 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net
        over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring
        thee up in my net.

032:004 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth
        upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the
        heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the
        whole earth with thee.

032:005 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the
        valleys with thy height.

032:006 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou
        swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full
        of thee.

032:007 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and
        make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a
        cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.

032:008 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee,
        and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.

032:009 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring
        thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which
        thou hast not known.

032:010 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
        shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my
        sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment,
        every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.

032:011 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon
        shall come upon thee.

032:012 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to
        fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall
        spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall
        be destroyed.

032:013 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the
        great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any
        more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

032:014 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to
        run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.

032:015 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country
        shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall
        smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I
        am the LORD.

032:016 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the
        daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament
        for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the
        Lord GOD.

032:017 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
        of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

032:018 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them
        down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto
        the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the
        pit.

032:019 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with
        the uncircumcised.

032:020 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
        sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her
        multitudes.

032:021 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the
        midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down,
        they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

032:022 Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:
        all of them slain, fallen by the sword:

032:023 Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company
        is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the
        sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.

032:024 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all
        of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down
        uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused
        their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne
        their shame with them that go down to the pit.

032:025 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
        multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them
        uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was
        caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their
        shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the
        midst of them that be slain.

032:026 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
        round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the
        sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the
        living.

032:027 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
        uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons
        of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but
        their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were
        the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

032:028 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,
        and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.

032:029 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with
        their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword:
        they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go
        down to the pit.

032:030 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
        Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their
        terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie
        uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear
        their shame with them that go down to the pit.

032:031 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
        multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword,
        saith the Lord GOD.

032:032 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he
        shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that
        are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude,
        saith the Lord GOD.

033:001 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

033:002 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto
        them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the
        land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their
        watchman:

033:003 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
        trumpet, and warn the people;

033:004 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh
        not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
        shall be upon his own head.

033:005 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
        blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall
        deliver his soul.

033:006 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the
        trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and
        take any person from among them, he is taken away in his
        iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.

033:007 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the
        house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my
        mouth, and warn them from me.

033:008 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely
        die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
        that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will
        I require at thine hand.

033:009 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from
        it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his
        iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

033:010 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
        Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be
        upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?

033:011 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no
        pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
        from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways;
        for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

033:012 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy
        people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver
        him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of
        the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he
        turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be
        able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.

033:013 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live;
        if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all
        his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his
        iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.

033:014 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if
        he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;

033:015 If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
        robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing
        iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.

033:016 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned
        unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he
        shall surely live.

033:017 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not
        equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.

033:018 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and
        committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.

033:019 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which
        is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.

033:020 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of
        Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.

033:021 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in
        the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that
        had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is
        smitten.

033:022 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he
        that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came
        to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no
        more dumb.

033:023 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

033:024 Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of
        Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the
        land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.

033:025 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with
        the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed
        blood: and shall ye possess the land?

033:026 Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile
        every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?

033:027 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live,
        surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword,
        and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to
        be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves
        shall die of the pestilence.

033:028 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
        strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be
        desolate, that none shall pass through.

033:029 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the
        land most desolate because of all their abominations which
        they have committed.

033:030 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are
        talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the
        houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother,
        saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that
        cometh forth from the LORD.

033:031 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit
        before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they
        will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love,
        but their heart goeth after their covetousness.

033:032 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that
        hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for
        they hear thy words, but they do them not.

033:033 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall
        they know that a prophet hath been among them.

034:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

034:002 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,
        prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the
        shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed
        themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

034:003 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them
        that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.

034:004 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
        that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was
        broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven
        away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with
        force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.

034:005 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and
        they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they
        were scattered.

034:006 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every
        high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of
        the earth, and none did search or seek after them.

034:007 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

034:008 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became
        a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field,
        because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search
        for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my
        flock;

034:009 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

034:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds;
        and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to
        cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed
        themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their
        mouth, that they may not be meat for them.

034:011 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both
        search my sheep, and seek them out.

034:012 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is
        among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my
        sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have
        been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

034:013 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them
        from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and
        feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in
        all the inhabited places of the country.

034:014 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high
        mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie
        in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the
        mountains of Israel.

034:015 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
        the Lord GOD.

034:016 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which
        was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and
        will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the
        fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

034:017 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
        judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he
        goats.

034:018 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
        pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of
        your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye
        must foul the residue with your feet?

034:019 And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with
        your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your
        feet.

034:020 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even
        I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean
        cattle.

034:021 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
        all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them
        abroad;

034:022 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a
        prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.

034:023 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
        them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall
        be their shepherd.

034:024 And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a
        prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.

034:025 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
        the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell
        safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

034:026 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
        blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his
        season; there shall be showers of blessing.

034:027 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth
        shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their
        land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken
        the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of
        those that served themselves of them.

034:028 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall
        the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell
        safely, and none shall make them afraid.

034:029 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall
        be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the
        shame of the heathen any more.

034:030 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them,
        and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith
        the Lord GOD.

034:031 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am
        your God, saith the Lord GOD.

035:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

035:002 Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy
        against it,

035:003 And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount
        Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand
        against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.

035:004 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and
        thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

035:005 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the
        blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in
        the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity
        had an end:

035:006 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee
        unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not
        hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.

035:007 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it
        him that passeth out and him that returneth.

035:008 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy
        hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they
        fall that are slain with the sword.

035:009 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall
        not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

035:010 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two
        countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the
        LORD was there:

035:011 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do
        according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which
        thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make
        myself known among them, when I have judged thee.

035:012 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard
        all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the
        mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are
        given us to consume.

035:013 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have
        multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.

035:014 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I
        will make thee desolate.

035:015 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of
        Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou
        shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of
        it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

036:001 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
        and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:

036:002 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against
        you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:

036:003 Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because
        they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every
        side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the
        heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are
        an infamy of the people:

036:004 Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
        GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the
        hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate
        wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a
        prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round
        about;

036:005 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my
        jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and
        against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their
        possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful
        minds, to cast it out for a prey.

036:006 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto
        the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the
        valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my
        jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of
        the heathen:

036:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand,
        Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their
        shame.

036:008 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
        branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for
        they are at hand to come.

036:009 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye
        shall be tilled and sown:

036:010 And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel,
        even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the
        wastes shall be builded:

036:011 And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall
        increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old
        estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings:
        and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

036:012 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;
        and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their
        inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of
        men.

036:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
        devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations:

036:014 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy
        nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.

036:015 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
        heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the
        people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall
        any more, saith the Lord GOD.

036:016 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

036:017 Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land,
        they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their
        way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.

036:018 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they
        had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had
        polluted it:

036:019 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were
        dispersed through the countries: according to their way and
        according to their doings I judged them.

036:020 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went,
        they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are
        the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.

036:021 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel
        had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.

036:022 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord
        GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for
        mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the
        heathen, whither ye went.

036:023 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among
        the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and
        the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD,
        when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.

036:024 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out
        of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

036:025 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
        clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will
        I cleanse you.

036:026 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
        within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your
        flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.

036:027 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
        my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

036:028 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
        and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

036:029 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
        call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine
        upon you.

036:030 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
        the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine
        among the heathen.

036:031 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings
        that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own
        sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

036:032 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known
        unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house
        of Israel.

036:033 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed
        you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in
        the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.

036:034 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
        in the sight of all that passed by.

036:035 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
        the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined
        cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.

036:036 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that
        I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was
        desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.

036:037 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
        the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them
        with men like a flock.

036:038 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
        feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of
        men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

037:001 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
        spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley
        which was full of bones,

037:002 And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there
        were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very
        dry.

037:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
        answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.

037:004 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
        them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

037:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
        breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:

037:006 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon
        you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye
        shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

037:007 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
        was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
        together, bone to his bone.

037:008 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
        them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath
        in them.

037:009 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
        man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from
        the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that
        they may live.

037:010 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
        them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an
        exceeding great army.

037:011 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
        house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and
        our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.

037:012 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
        Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to
        come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
        Israel.

037:013 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
        graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

037:014 And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall
        place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD
        have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.

037:015 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

037:016 Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon
        it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions:
        then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the
        stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his
        companions:

037:017 And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall
        become one in thine hand.

037:018 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
        saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?

037:019 Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take
        the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the
        tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even
        with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they
        shall be one in mine hand.

037:020 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
        before their eyes.

037:021 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
        take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither
        they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring
        them into their own land:

037:022 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains
        of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they
        shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided
        into two kingdoms any more at all.

037:023 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their
        idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their
        transgressions: but I will save them out of all their
        dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse
        them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

037:024 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all
        shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments,
        and observe my statutes, and do them.

037:025 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob
        my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall
        dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their
        children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be
        their prince for ever.

037:026 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall
        be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them,
        and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of
        them for evermore.

037:027 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their
        God, and they shall be my people.

037:028 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
        when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

038:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

038:002 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the
        chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

038:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
        Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

038:004 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I
        will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and
        horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a
        great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling
        swords:

038:005 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield
        and helmet:

038:006 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north
        quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.

038:007 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
        company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto
        them.

038:008 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years
        thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the
        sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the
        mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is
        brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely
        all of them.

038:009 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a
        cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many
        people with thee.

038:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at
        the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt
        think an evil thought:

038:011 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled
        villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell
        safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither
        bars nor gates,

038:012 To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon
        the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the
        people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten
        cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.

038:013 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the
        young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to
        take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey?
        to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods,
        to take a great spoil?

038:014 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith
        the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth
        safely, shalt thou not know it?

038:015 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts,
        thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon
        horses, a great company, and a mighty army:

038:016 And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud
        to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will
        bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when
        I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.

038:017 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in
        old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which
        prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee
        against them?

038:018 And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come
        against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury
        shall come up in my face.

038:019 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
        Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land
        of Israel;

038:020 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven,
        and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that
        creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face
        of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains
        shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and
        every wall shall fall to the ground.

038:021 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
        mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be
        against his brother.

038:022 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood;
        and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the
        many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great
        hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

038:023 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
        known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

039:001 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say,
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the
        chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

039:002 And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of
        thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and
        will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:

039:003 And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause
        thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

039:004 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all
        thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee
        unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of
        the field to be devoured.

039:005 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it,
        saith the Lord GOD.

039:006 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
        carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the
        LORD.

039:007 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
        Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more:
        and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in
        Israel.

039:008 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this
        is the day whereof I have spoken.

039:009 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,
        and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields
        and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves,
        and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven
        years:

039:010 So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut
        down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons
        with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and
        rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.

039:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto
        Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the
        passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses
        of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his
        multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.

039:012 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
        that they may cleanse the land.

039:013 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall
        be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith
        the Lord GOD.

039:014 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
        through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain
        upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of
        seven months shall they search.

039:015 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth
        a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the
        buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.

039:016 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall
        they cleanse the land.

039:017 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto
        every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field,
        Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side
        to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great
        sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh,
        and drink blood.

039:018 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of
        the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of
        bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

039:019 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye
        be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

039:020 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
        with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.

039:021 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen
        shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I
        have laid upon them.

039:022 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God
        from that day and forward.

039:023 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
        captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against
        me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the
        hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.

039:024 According to their uncleanness and according to their
        transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from
        them.

039:025 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
        captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of
        Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;

039:026 After that they have borne their shame, and all their
        trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they
        dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.

039:027 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered
        them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in
        the sight of many nations;

039:028 Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which
        caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I
        have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of
        them any more there.

039:029 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
        poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord
        GOD.

040:001 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the
        beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the
        fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the
        selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me
        thither.

040:002 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
        and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the
        frame of a city on the south.

040:003 And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
        appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of
        flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the
        gate.

040:004 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes,
        and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I
        shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto
        thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to
        the house of Israel.

040:005 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and
        in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the
        cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the
        building, one reed; and the height, one reed.

040:006 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and
        went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the
        gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the
        gate, which was one reed broad.

040:007 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed
        broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and
        the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was
        one reed.

040:008 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

040:009 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
        posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was
        inward.

040:010 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on
        this side, and three on that side; they three were of one
        measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on
        that side.

040:011 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
        cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

040:012 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on
        this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the
        little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits
        on that side.

040:013 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber
        to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty
        cubits, door against door.

040:014 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of
        the court round about the gate.

040:015 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of
        the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

040:016 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to
        their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the
        arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each
        post were palm trees.

040:017 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
        chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about:
        thirty chambers were upon the pavement.

040:018 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
        length of the gates was the lower pavement.

040:019 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower
        gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred
        cubits eastward and northward.

040:020 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the
        north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth
        thereof.

040:021 And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and
        three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches
        thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length
        thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty
        cubits.

040:022 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,
        were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the
        east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches
        thereof were before them.

040:023 And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate
        toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from
        gate to gate an hundred cubits.

040:024 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
        toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the
        arches thereof according to these measures.

040:025 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round
        about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and
        the breadth five and twenty cubits.

040:026 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches
        thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this
        side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.

040:027 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and
        he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred
        cubits.

040:028 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
        measured the south gate according to these measures;

040:029 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and
        the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there
        were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it
        was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

040:030 And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long,
        and five cubits broad.

040:031 And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had
        eight steps.

040:032 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
        measured the gate according to these measures.

040:033 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and
        the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and
        there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round
        about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits
        broad.

040:034 And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
        side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

040:035 And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according
        to these measures;

040:036 The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches
        thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was
        fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

040:037 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
        side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

040:038 And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of
        the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

040:039 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and
        two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering
        and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

040:040 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
        north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was
        at the porch of the gate, were two tables.

040:041 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side,
        by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew
        their sacrifices.

040:042 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,
        of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad,
        and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments
        wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

040:043 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about:
        and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.

040:044 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
        the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and
        their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the
        east gate having the prospect toward the north.

040:045 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward
        the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of
        the house.

040:046 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
        priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the
        sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the
        LORD to minister unto him.

040:047 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an
        hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was
        before the house.

040:048 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each
        post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits
        on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on
        this side, and three cubits on that side.

040:049 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth
        eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they
        went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on
        this side, and another on that side.

041:001 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
        six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the
        other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.

041:002 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of
        the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on
        the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty
        cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.

041:003 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
        cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door,
        seven cubits.

041:004 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
        breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto
        me, This is the most holy place.

041:005 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
        breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the
        house on every side.

041:006 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty
        in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the
        house for the side chambers round about, that they might have
        hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.

041:007 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward
        to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went
        still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of
        the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest
        chamber to the highest by the midst.

041:008 I saw also the height of the house round about: the
        foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great
        cubits.

041:009 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber
        without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the
        place of the side chambers that were within.

041:010 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits
        round about the house on every side.

041:011 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
        was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward
        the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five
        cubits round about.

041:012 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
        toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the
        building was five cubits thick round about, and the length
        thereof ninety cubits.

041:013 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the
        separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an
        hundred cubits long;

041:014 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate
        place toward the east, an hundred cubits.

041:015 And he measured the length of the building over against the
        separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof
        on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with
        the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

041:016 The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries
        round about on their three stories, over against the door,
        cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the
        windows, and the windows were covered;

041:017 To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and
        without, and by all the wall round about within and without,
        by measure.

041:018 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
        tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had
        two faces;

041:019 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one
        side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the
        other side: it was made through all the house round about.

041:020 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
        trees made, and on the wall of the temple.

041:021 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the
        sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the
        other.

041:022 The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length
        thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length
        thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto
        me, This is the table that is before the LORD.

041:023 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

041:024 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
        leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.

041:025 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
        cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls;
        and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch
        without.

041:026 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side
        and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the
        side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

042:001 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward
        the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over
        against the separate place, and which was before the building
        toward the north.

042:002 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and
        the breadth was fifty cubits.

042:003 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,
        and over against the pavement which was for the utter court,
        was gallery against gallery in three stories.

042:004 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth
        inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.

042:005 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
        higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of
        the building.

042:006 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
        pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened
        more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

042:007 And the wall that was without over against the chambers,
        toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the
        length thereof was fifty cubits.

042:008 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court
        was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred
        cubits.

042:009 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side,
        as one goeth into them from the utter court.

042:010 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
        toward the east, over against the separate place, and over
        against the building.

042:011 And the way before them was like the appearance of the
        chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as
        broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to
        their fashions, and according to their doors.

042:012 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward
        the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way
        directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into
        them.

042:013 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south
        chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy
        chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall
        eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy
        things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the
        trespass offering; for the place is holy.

042:014 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of
        the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay
        their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and
        shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those
        things which are for the people.

042:015 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
        brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the
        east, and measured it round about.

042:016 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five
        hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

042:017 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
        measuring reed round about.

042:018 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the
        measuring reed.

042:019 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
        reeds with the measuring reed.

042:020 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
        five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a
        separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

043:001 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that
        looketh toward the east:

043:002 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way
        of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters:
        and the earth shined with his glory.

043:003 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I
        saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to
        destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I
        saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

043:004 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of
        the gate whose prospect is toward the east.

043:005 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
        and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

043:006 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man
        stood by me.

043:007 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and
        the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the
        midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name,
        shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor
        their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their
        kings in their high places.

043:008 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and
        their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they
        have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they
        have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.

043:009 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of
        their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of
        them for ever.

043:010 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that
        they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure
        the pattern.

043:011 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them
        the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings
        out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms
        thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms
        thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their
        sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the
        ordinances thereof, and do them.

043:012 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the
        whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold,
        this is the law of the house.

043:013 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The
        cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be
        a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by
        the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall
        be the higher place of the altar.

043:014 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
        shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the
        lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits,
        and the breadth one cubit.

043:015 So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and
        upward shall be four horns.

043:016 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad,
        square in the four squares thereof.

043:017 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen
        broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it
        shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit
        about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.

043:018 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD;
        These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they
        shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to
        sprinkle blood thereon.

043:019 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the
        seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me,
        saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.

043:020 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the
        four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and
        upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge
        it.

043:021 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he
        shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the
        sanctuary.

043:022 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
        without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the
        altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.

043:023 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a
        young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock
        without blemish.

043:024 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests
        shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a
        burnt offering unto the LORD.

043:025 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin
        offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram
        out of the flock, without blemish.

043:026 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they
        shall consecrate themselves.

043:027 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the
        eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt
        offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will
        accept you, saith the Lord GOD.

044:001 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
        sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.

044:002 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall
        not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the
        LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it
        shall be shut.

044:003 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat
        bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch
        of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.

044:004 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
        and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the
        house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.

044:005 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold
        with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto
        thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD,
        and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the
        house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.

044:006 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of
        Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it
        suffice you of all your abominations,

044:007 In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers,
        uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in
        my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my
        bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant
        because of all your abominations.

044:008 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye
        have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

044:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart,
        nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of
        any stranger that is among the children of Israel.

044:010 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel
        went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols;
        they shall even bear their iniquity.

044:011 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
        the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they
        shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the
        people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto
        them.

044:012 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and
        caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore
        have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD,
        and they shall bear their iniquity.

044:013 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a
        priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in
        the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and
        their abominations which they have committed.

044:014 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for
        all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done
        therein.

044:015 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
        charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray
        from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and
        they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the
        blood, saith the Lord GOD:

044:016 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near
        to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my
        charge.

044:017 And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the
        gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen
        garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they
        minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

044:018 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have
        linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird
        themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.

044:019 And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the
        utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments
        wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers,
        and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not
        sanctify the people with their garments.

044:020 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks
        to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.

044:021 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the
        inner court.

044:022 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that
        is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the
        house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.

044:023 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
        and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and
        the clean.

044:024 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they
        shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep
        my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall
        hallow my sabbaths.

044:025 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves:
        but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter,
        for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may
        defile themselves.

044:026 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven
        days.

044:027 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the
        inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his
        sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.

044:028 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their
        inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I
        am their possession.

044:029 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and
        the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel
        shall be theirs.

044:030 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
        oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the
        priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your
        dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.

044:031 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,
        or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

045:001 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for
        inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy
        portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five
        and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten
        thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round
        about.

045:002 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in
        length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and
        fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.

045:003 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
        twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it
        shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.

045:004 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
        ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister
        unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and
        an holy place for the sanctuary.

045:005 And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten
        thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of
        the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty
        chambers.

045:006 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
        broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the
        oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house
        of Israel.

045:007 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on
        the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the
        possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy
        portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west
        side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length
        shall be over against one of the portions, from the west
        border unto the east border.

045:008 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes
        shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land
        shall they give to the house of Israel according to their
        tribes.

045:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of
        Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and
        justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the
        Lord GOD.

045:010 Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just
        bath.

045:011 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath
        may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the
        tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the
        homer.

045:012 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five
        and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

045:013 This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an
        ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part
        of an ephah of an homer of barley:

045:014 Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall
        offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an
        homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:

045:015 And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the
        fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt
        offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for
        them, saith the Lord GOD.

045:016 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the
        prince in Israel.

045:017 And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and
        meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the
        new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the
        house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the
        meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace
        offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

045:018 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day
        of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish,
        and cleanse the sanctuary:

045:019 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,
        and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four
        corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the
        gate of the inner court.

045:020 And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every
        one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye
        reconcile the house.

045:021 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye
        shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened
        bread shall be eaten.

045:022 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for
        all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.

045:023 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering
        to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish
        daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin
        offering.

045:024 And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a
        bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an
        ephah.

045:025 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall
        he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to
        the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and
        according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.

046:001 Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that
        looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days;
        but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the
        new moon it shall be opened.
046:002 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that
        gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the
        priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace
        offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:
        then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until
        the evening.

046:003 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of
        this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new
        moons.

046:004 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the
        LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish,
        and a ram without blemish.

046:005 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the
        meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and
        an hin of oil to an ephah.

046:006 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock
        without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be
        without blemish.

046:007 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock,
        and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his
        hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

046:008 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of
        the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way
        thereof.

046:009 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in
        the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north
        gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and
        he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth
        by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way
        of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over
        against it.

046:010 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go
        in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.

046:011 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering
        shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to
        the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an
        ephah.

046:012 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering
        or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then
        open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall
        prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did
        on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his
        going forth one shall shut the gate.

046:013 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a
        lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it
        every morning.

046:014 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning,
        the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of
        oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering
        continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.

046:015 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and
        the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.

046:016 Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of
        his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall
        be their possession by inheritance.

046:017 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his
        servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after
        it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be
        his sons' for them.

046:018 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance
        by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he
        shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession:
        that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.

046:019 After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side
        of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which
        looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the
        two sides westward.

046:020 Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests
        shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where
        they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out
        into the utter court, to sanctify the people.

046:021 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me
        to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in
        every corner of the court there was a court.

046:022 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of
        forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of
        one measure.

046:023 And there was a row of building round about in them, round
        about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the
        rows round about.

046:024 Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil,
        where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of
        the people.

047:001 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,
        behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the
        house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward
        the east, and the waters came down from under from the right
        side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

047:002 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and
        led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way
        that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on
        the right side.

047:003 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth
        eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me
        through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.

047:004 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the
        waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a
        thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the
        loins.

047:005 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I
        could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim
        in, a river that could not be passed over.

047:006 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he
        brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

047:007 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were
        very many trees on the one side and on the other.

047:008 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east
        country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea:
        which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be
        healed.

047:009 And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which
        moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and
        there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these
        waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every
        thing shall live whither the river cometh.

047:010 And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon
        it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to
        spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their
        kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.

047:011 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not
        be healed; they shall be given to salt.

047:012 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on
        that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not
        fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall
        bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their
        waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof
        shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.

047:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye
        shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of
        Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.

047:014 And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning
        the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers:
        and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.

047:015 And this shall be the border of the land toward the north
        side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to
        Zedad;

047:016 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of
        Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by
        the coast of Hauran.

047:017 And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of
        Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath.
        And this is the north side.

047:018 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from
        Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by
        Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the
        east side.

047:019 And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of
        strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the
        south side southward.

047:020 The west side also shall be the great sea from the border,
        till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.

047:021 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes
        of Israel.

047:022 And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for
        an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn
        among you, which shall beget children among you: and they
        shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of
        Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes
        of Israel.

047:023 And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger
        sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the
        Lord GOD.

048:001 Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to
        the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath,
        Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of
        Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for
        Dan.

048:002 And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west
        side, a portion for Asher.

048:003 And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the
        west side, a portion for Naphtali.

048:004 And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the
        west side, a portion for Manasseh.

048:005 And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the
        west side, a portion for Ephraim.

048:006 And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the
        west side, a portion for Reuben.

048:007 And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west
        side, a portion for Judah.

048:008 And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west
        side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and
        twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the
        other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the
        sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

048:009 The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of
        five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in
        breadth.

048:010 And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy
        oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length,
        and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the
        east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and
        twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall
        be in the midst thereof.

048:011 It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of
        Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when
        the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went
        astray.

048:012 And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto
        them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.

048:013 And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall
        have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in
        breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and
        the breadth ten thousand.

048:014 And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate
        the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.

048:015 And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over
        against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place
        for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city
        shall be in the midst thereof.

048:016 And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four
        thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand
        and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five
        hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.

048:017 And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two
        hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty,
        and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west
        two hundred and fifty.

048:018 And the residue in length over against the oblation of the
        holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand
        westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the
        holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto
        them that serve the city.

048:019 And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the
        tribes of Israel.

048:020 All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and
        twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare,
        with the possession of the city.

048:021 And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and
        on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of
        the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the
        oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the
        five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against
        the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy
        oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst
        thereof.

048:022 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the
        possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is
        the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of
        Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

048:023 As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the
        west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.

048:024 And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the
        west side, Simeon shall have a portion.

048:025 And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west
        side, Issachar a portion.

048:026 And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the
        west side, Zebulun a portion.

048:027 And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west
        side, Gad a portion.

048:028 And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the
        border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in
        Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.

048:029 This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes
        of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith
        the Lord GOD.

048:030 And these are the goings out of the city on the north side,
        four thousand and five hundred measures.

048:031 And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the
        tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben,
        one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.

048:032 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three
        gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate
        of Dan.

048:033 And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:
        and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one
        gate of Zebulun.

048:034 At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their
        three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of
        Naphtali.

048:035 It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of
        the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.

Book 27	Daniel

001:001 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged
        it.

001:002 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with
        part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into
        the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the
        vessels into the treasure house of his god.

001:003 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
        that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of
        the king's seed, and of the princes;

001:004 Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and
        skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and
        understanding science, and such as had ability in them to
        stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the
        learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.

001:005 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's
        meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three
        years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the
        king.

001:006 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel,
        Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:

001:007 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave
        unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of
        Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of
        Abednego.

001:008 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
        himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine
        which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the
        eunuchs that he might not defile himself.

001:009 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with
        the prince of the eunuchs.

001:010 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord
        the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why
        should he see your faces worse liking than the children which
        are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to
        the king.

001:011 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had
        set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

001:012 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them
        give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.

001:013 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
        countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the
        king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.

001:014 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten
        days.

001:015 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer
        and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the
        portion of the king's meat.

001:016 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
        that they should drink; and gave them pulse.

001:017 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill
        in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in
        all visions and dreams.

001:018 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
        bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
        before Nebuchadnezzar.

001:019 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found
        none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore
        stood they before the king.

001:020 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king
        enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the
        magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.

001:021 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

002:001 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
        Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was
        troubled, and his sleep brake from him.

002:002 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the
        astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew
        the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.

002:003 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my
        spirit was troubled to know the dream.

002:004 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live
        for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the
        interpretation.

002:005 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
        from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the
        interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your
        houses shall be made a dunghill.

002:006 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye
        shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour:
        therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.

002:007 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants
        the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

002:008 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would
        gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.

002:009 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but
        one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt
        words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore
        tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the
        interpretation thereof.

002:010 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not
        a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter:
        therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such
        things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.

002:011 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is
        none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods,
        whose dwelling is not with flesh.

002:012 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and
        commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

002:013 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain;
        and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

002:014 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
        captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the
        wise men of Babylon:

002:015 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the
        decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing
        known to Daniel.

002:016 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would
        give him time, and that he would shew the king the
        interpretation.

002:017 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
        Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

002:018 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning
        this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish
        with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

002:019 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
        Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

002:020 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever
        and ever: for wisdom and might are his:

002:021 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings,
        and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and
        knowledge to them that know understanding:

002:022 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in
        the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

002:023 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who
        hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me
        now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto
        us the king's matter.

002:024 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had
        ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said
        thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me
        in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the
        interpretation.

002:025 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and
        said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of
        Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.

002:026 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was
        Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream
        which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?

002:027 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The
        secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the
        astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the
        king;

002:028 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and
        maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
        latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy
        bed, are these;

002:029 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy
        bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth
        secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.

002:030 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any
        wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes
        that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that
        thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.

002:031 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great
        image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and
        the form thereof was terrible.

002:032 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
        silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

002:033 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.

002:034 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
        smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and
        brake them to pieces.

002:035 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
        gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of
        the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away,
        that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the
        image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

002:036 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
        before the king.

002:037 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
        given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.

002:038 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
        field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine
        hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this
        head of gold.

002:039 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee,
        and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over
        all the earth.

002:040 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as
        iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron
        that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.

002:041 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters'
        clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but
        there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as
        thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.

002:042 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of
        clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly
        broken.

002:043 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
        mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not
        cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

002:044 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up
        a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
        shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in
        pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for
        ever.

002:045 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
        mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron,
        the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God
        hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter:
        and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

002:046 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and
        worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an
        oblation and sweet odours unto him.

002:047 The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is,
        that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a
        revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.

002:048 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great
        gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon,
        and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.

002:049 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach,
        Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of
        Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

003:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
        was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he
        set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

003:002 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the
        princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the
        treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
        of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which
        Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

003:003 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
        treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
        of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication
        of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they
        stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

003:004 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
        nations, and languages,

003:005 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute,
        harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye
        fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
        king hath set up:

003:006 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour
        be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

003:007 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of
        the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of
        musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell
        down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
        king had set up.

003:008 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and
        accused the Jews.

003:009 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live
        for ever.

003:010 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall
        hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
        and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and
        worship the golden image:

003:011 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be
        cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

003:012 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of
        the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego;
        these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy
        gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

003:013 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men
        before the king.

003:014 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor
        worship the golden image which I have set up?

003:015 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the
        cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all
        kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I
        have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the
        same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who
        is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

003:016 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the
        king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in
        this matter.

003:017 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
        the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine
        hand, O king.

003:018 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not
        serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast
        set up.

003:019 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
        visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:
        therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the
        furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.

003:020 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
        bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into
        the burning fiery furnace.

003:021 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and
        their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the
        midst of the burning fiery furnace.

003:022 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the
        furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men
        that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

003:023 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell
        down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

003:024 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
        haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we
        cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered
        and said unto the king, True, O king.

003:025 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
        midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the
        fourth is like the Son of God.

003:026 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
        fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and
        Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and
        come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth
        of the midst of the fire.

003:027 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's
        counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon
        whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their
        head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell
        of fire had passed on them.

003:028 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and
        delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed
        the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not
        serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

003:029 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
        language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and
        their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no
        other God that can deliver after this sort.

003:030 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the
        province of Babylon.

004:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and
        languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
        unto you.

004:002 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high
        God hath wrought toward me.

004:003 How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his
        kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from
        generation to generation.

004:004 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in
        my palace:

004:005 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my
        bed and the visions of my head troubled me.

004:006 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of
        Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the
        interpretation of the dream.

004:007 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
        and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but
        they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.

004:008 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
        Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is
        the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream,
        saying,

004:009 O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that
        the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret
        troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have
        seen, and the interpretation thereof.

004:010 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and
        behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height
        thereof was great.

004:011 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
        unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the
        earth:

004:012 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and
        in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow
        under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
        thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.

004:013 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a
        watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;

004:014 He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off
        his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let
        the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his
        branches:

004:015 Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even
        with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
        field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his
        portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:

004:016 Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart
        be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

004:017 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand
        by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living
        may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
        giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the
        basest of men.

004:018 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
        Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as
        all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto
        me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of
        the holy gods is in thee.

004:019 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
        hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said,
        Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation
        thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My
        lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the
        interpretation thereof to thine enemies.

004:020 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
        height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all
        the earth;

004:021 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
        was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
        and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their
        habitation:

004:022 It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy
        greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion
        to the end of the earth.

004:023 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
        from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it;
        yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even
        with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
        field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his
        portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass
        over him;

004:024 This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of
        the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:

004:025 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
        with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat
        grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven,
        and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the
        most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
        whomsoever he will.

004:026 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree
        roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou
        shalt have known that the heavens do rule.

004:027 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
        break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by
        shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy
        tranquillity.

004:028 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

004:029 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
        kingdom of Babylon.

004:030 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I
        have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my
        power, and for the honour of my majesty?

004:031 While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice
        from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is
        spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.

004:032 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
        with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat
        grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until
        thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
        giveth it to whomsoever he will.

004:033 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and
        he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his
        body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown
        like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.

004:034 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
        eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and
        I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that
        liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion,
        and his kingdom is from generation to generation:

004:035 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing:
        and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and
        among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his
        hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?

004:036 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory
        of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me;
        and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was
        established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added
        unto me.

004:037 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
        heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and
        those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

005:001 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
        lords, and drank wine before the thousand.

005:002 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
        golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had
        taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king,
        and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink
        therein.

005:003 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of
        the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the
        king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in
        them.

005:004 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
        of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

005:005 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote
        over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of
        the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that
        wrote.

005:006 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts
        troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and
        his knees smote one against another.

005:007 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
        Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said
        to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing,
        and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with
        scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be
        the third ruler in the kingdom.

005:008 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read
        the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation
        thereof.

005:009 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance
        was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

005:010 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
        came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O
        king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor
        let thy countenance be changed:

005:011 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the
        holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and
        understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was
        found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the
        king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians,
        astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;

005:012 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and
        understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard
        sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same
        Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be
        called, and he will shew the interpretation.

005:013 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
        and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the
        children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father
        brought out of Jewry?

005:014 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in
        thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is
        found in thee.

005:015 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
        before me, that they should read this writing, and make known
        unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew
        the interpretation of the thing:

005:016 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
        interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read
        the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof,
        thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold
        about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

005:017 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts
        be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will
        read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the
        interpretation.

005:018 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father
        a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:

005:019 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and
        languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he
        slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he
        set up; and whom he would he put down.

005:020 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in
        pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took
        his glory from him:

005:021 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made
        like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses:
        they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with
        the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled
        in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it
        whomsoever he will.

005:022 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
        though thou knewest all this;

005:023 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
        they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and
        thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk
        wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and
        gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor
        hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and
        whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:

005:024 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing
        was written.

005:025 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
        UPHARSIN.

005:026 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath
        numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.

005:027 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
        wanting.

005:028 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
        Persians.

005:029 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with
        scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a
        proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler
        in the kingdom.

005:030 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

005:031 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
        and two years old.

006:001 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and
        twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;

006:002 And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first:
        that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king
        should have no damage.

006:003 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and
        princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king
        thought to set him over the whole realm.

006:004 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion
        against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find
        none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither
        was there any error or fault found in him.

006:005 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
        this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law
        of his God.

006:006 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the
        king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.

006:007 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the
        princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted
        together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm
        decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man
        for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into
        the den of lions.

006:008 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that
        it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and
        Persians, which altereth not.

006:009 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

006:010 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into
        his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
        Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and
        prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.

006:011 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
        supplication before his God.

006:012 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the
        king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man
        that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty
        days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of
        lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true,
        according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth
        not.

006:013 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel,
        which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
        not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but
        maketh his petition three times a day.

006:014 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased
        with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and
        he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.

006:015 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the
        king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is,
        That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be
        changed.

006:016 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him
        into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto
        Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver
        thee.

006:017 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
        and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the
        signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed
        concerning Daniel.

006:018 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night
        fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before
        him: and his sleep went from him.

006:019 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in
        haste unto the den of lions.

006:020 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
        unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel,
        servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest
        continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?

006:021 Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.

006:022 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths,
        that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency
        was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no
        hurt.

006:023 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that
        they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken
        up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him,
        because he believed in his God.

006:024 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
        accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions,
        them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the
        mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever
        they came at the bottom of the den.

006:025 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and
        languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
        unto you.

006:026 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
        tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the
        living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which
        shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto
        the end.

006:027 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders
        in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the
        power of the lions.

006:028 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the
        reign of Cyrus the Persian.

007:001 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a
        dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the
        dream, and told the sum of the matters.

007:002 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and,
        behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great
        sea.

007:003 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
        another.

007:004 The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld
        till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from
        the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's
        heart was given to it.

007:005 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it
        raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the
        mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto
        it, Arise, devour much flesh.

007:006 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
        upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also
        four heads; and dominion was given to it.

007:007 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth
        beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it
        had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and
        stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse
        from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.

007:008 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
        another little horn, before whom there were three of the first
        horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were
        eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

007:009 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
        days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of
        his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery
        flame, and his wheels as burning fire.

007:010 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
        thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten
        thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books
        were opened.

007:011 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which
        the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and
        his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

007:012 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
        taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and
        time.

007:013 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of
        man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of
        days, and they brought him near before him.

007:014 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
        that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his
        dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
        away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.

007:015 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and
        the visions of my head troubled me.

007:016 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
        truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the
        interpretation of the things.

007:017 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which
        shall arise out of the earth.

007:018 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
        possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

007:019 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
        diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
        were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in
        pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;

007:020 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other
        which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn
        that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose
        look was more stout than his fellows.

007:021 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
        prevailed against them;

007:022 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the
        saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints
        possessed the kingdom.

007:023 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
        upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and
        shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and
        break it in pieces.

007:024 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
        arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be
        diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.

007:025 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and
        shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to
        change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand
        until a time and times and the dividing of time.

007:026 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
        dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.

007:027 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
        under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the
        saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting
        kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

007:028 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
        cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in
        me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

008:001 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
        appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which
        appeared unto me at the first.

008:002 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I
        was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of
        Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

008:003 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
        before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns
        were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher
        came up last.

008:004 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward;
        so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there
        any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according
        to his will, and became great.

008:005 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the
        west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the
        ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.

008:006 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
        standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his
        power.

008:007 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
        choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two
        horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him,
        but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and
        there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.

008:008 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was
        strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four
        notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.

008:009 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
        exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and
        toward the pleasant land.

008:010 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast
        down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and
        stamped upon them.

008:011 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and
        by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of
        the sanctuary was cast down.

008:012 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by
        reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the
        ground; and it practised, and prospered.

008:013 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
        that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision
        concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of
        desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be
        trodden under foot?

008:014 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
        then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.

008:015 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the
        vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood
        before me as the appearance of a man.

008:016 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which
        called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the
        vision.

008:017 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
        and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son
        of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.

008:018 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my
        face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.

008:019 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in
        the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the
        end shall be.

008:020 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of
        Media and Persia.

008:021 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn
        that is between his eyes is the first king.

008:022 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
        kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his
        power.

008:023 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the
        transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce
        countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.

008:024 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and
        he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise,
        and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.

008:025 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
        his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by
        peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the
        Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.

008:026 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told
        is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be
        for many days.

008:027 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I
        rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at
        the vision, but none understood it.

009:001 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed
        of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the
        Chaldeans;

009:002 In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books
        the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to
        Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years
        in the desolations of Jerusalem.

009:003 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
        supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:

009:004 And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and
        said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant
        and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his
        commandments;

009:005 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done
        wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy
        precepts and from thy judgments:

009:006 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets,
        which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our
        fathers, and to all the people of the land.

009:007 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us
        confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and
        to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are
        near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither
        thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they
        have trespassed against thee.

009:008 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to
        our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned
        against thee.

009:009 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though
        we have rebelled against him;

009:010 Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk
        in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the
        prophets.

009:011 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
        that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is
        poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of
        Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.

009:012 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us,
        and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a
        great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as
        hath been done upon Jerusalem.

009:013 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come
        upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God,
        that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy
        truth.

009:014 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it
        upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works
        which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.

009:015 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth
        out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten
        thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done
        wickedly.

009:016 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee,
        let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city
        Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for
        the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are
        become a reproach to all that are about us.

009:017 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and
        his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy
        sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.

009:018 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
        behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy
        name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for
        our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.

009:019 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
        not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people
        are called by thy name.

009:020 And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin
        and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my
        supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of
        my God;

009:021 Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel,
        whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused
        to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening
        oblation.

009:022 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I
        am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

009:023 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came
        forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly
        beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the
        vision.

009:024 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
        city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
        and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
        everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
        prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

009:025 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of
        the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
        Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and
        two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even
        in troublous times.

009:026 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,
        but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall
        come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end
        thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war
        desolations are determined.

009:027 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and
        in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the
        oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations
        he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and
        that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

010:001 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
        unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing
        was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood
        the thing, and had understanding of the vision.

010:002 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.

010:003 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my
        mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole
        weeks were fulfilled.

010:004 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was
        by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;

010:005 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain
        man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold
        of Uphaz:

010:006 His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the
        appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and
        his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and
        the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.

010:007 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with
        me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so
        that they fled to hide themselves.

010:008 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and
        there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned
        in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.

010:009 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice
        of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my
        face toward the ground.

010:010 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees
        and upon the palms of my hands.

010:011 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,
        understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand
        upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken
        this word unto me, I stood trembling.

010:012 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
        that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten
        thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come
        for thy words.

010:013 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
        twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came
        to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

010:014 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
        people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many
        days.

010:015 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face
        toward the ground, and I became dumb.

010:016 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men
        touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said
        unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my
        sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.

010:017 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my
        lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in
        me, neither is there breath left in me.

010:018 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance
        of a man, and he strengthened me,

010:019 And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee,
        be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I
        was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast
        strengthened me.

010:020 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
        will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I
        am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.

010:021 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
        truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things,
        but Michael your prince.

011:001 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
        confirm and to strengthen him.

011:002 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand
        up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far
        richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches
        he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.

011:003 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
        dominion, and do according to his will.

011:004 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
        shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to
        his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled:
        for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside
        those.

011:005 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his
        princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion;
        his dominion shall be a great dominion.

011:006 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together;
        for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of
        the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the
        power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she
        shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that
        begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.

011:007 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
        estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into
        the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against
        them, and shall prevail:

011:008 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with
        their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and
        of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the
        north.

011:009 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and
        shall return into his own land.

011:010 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a
        multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and
        overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be
        stirred up, even to his fortress.

011:011 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and
        shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the
        north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the
        multitude shall be given into his hand.

011:012 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be
        lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he
        shall not be strengthened by it.

011:013 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
        multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come
        after certain years with a great army and with much riches.

011:014 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king
        of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt
        themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.

011:015 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and
        take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall
        not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there
        be any strength to withstand.

011:016 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
        will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in
        the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.

011:017 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
        whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do:
        and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her:
        but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.

011:018 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall
        take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the
        reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he
        shall cause it to turn upon him.

011:019 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:
        but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.

011:020 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the
        glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be
        destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.

011:021 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
        shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in
        peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

011:022 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from
        before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the
        covenant.

011:023 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
        for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small
        people.

011:024 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
        province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not
        done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them
        the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast
        his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.

011:025 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the
        king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south
        shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty
        army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices
        against him.

011:026 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
        him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down
        slain.

011:027 And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and
        they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper:
        for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.

011:028 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
        heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do
        exploits, and return to his own land.

011:029 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
        south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.

011:030 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
        shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the
        holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have
        intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.

011:031 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
        sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily
        sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh
        desolate.

011:032 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt
        by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be
        strong, and do exploits.

011:033 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
        yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity,
        and by spoil, many days.

011:034 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
        help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.

011:035 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and
        to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end:
        because it is yet for a time appointed.

011:036 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall
        exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall
        speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall
        prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is
        determined shall be done.

011:037 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
        of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself
        above all.

011:038 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
        whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and
        silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.

011:039 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
        whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he
        shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land
        for gain.

011:040 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
        him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a
        whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many
        ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall
        overflow and pass over.

011:041 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
        shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand,
        even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

011:042 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and
        the land of Egypt shall not escape.

011:043 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
        silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the
        Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.

011:044 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
        him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy,
        and utterly to make away many.

011:045 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
        seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his
        end, and none shall help him.

012:001 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince
        which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall
        be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a
        nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people
        shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in
        the book.

012:002 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
        awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
        everlasting contempt.

012:003 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
        firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the
        stars for ever and ever.

012:004 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even
        to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
        knowledge shall be increased.

012:005 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the
        one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on
        that side of the bank of the river.

012:006 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
        waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these
        wonders?

012:007 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
        waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his
        left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever
        that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he
        shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy
        people, all these things shall be finished.

012:008 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord,
        what shall be the end of these things?

012:009 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up
        and sealed till the time of the end.

012:010 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
        wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
        understand; but the wise shall understand.

012:011 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken
        away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there
        shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.

012:012 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three
        hundred and five and thirty days.

012:013 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and
        stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

Book 28	Hosea

001:001 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,
        in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
        Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of
        Israel.

001:002 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD
        said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
        children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great
        whoredom, departing from the LORD.

001:003 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
        conceived, and bare him a son.

001:004 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
        little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the
        house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the
        house of Israel.

001:005 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the
        bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.

001:006 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said
        unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have
        mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them
        away.

001:007 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save
        them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor
        by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

001:008 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a
        son.

001:009 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people,
        and I will not be your God.

001:010 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand
        of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it
        shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
        them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them,
        Ye are the sons of the living God.

001:011 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
        gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they
        shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of
        Jezreel.

002:001 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

002:002 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither
        am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out
        of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

002:003 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
        born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry
        land, and slay her with thirst.

002:004 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
        children of whoredoms.

002:005 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived
        them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my
        lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my
        flax, mine oil and my drink.

002:006 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
        make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.

002:007 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
        overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
        them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first
        husband; for then was it better with me than now.

002:008 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
        and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for
        Baal.

002:009 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
        thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover
        my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.

002:010 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her
        lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

002:011 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her
        new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

002:012 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she
        hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me:
        and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field
        shall eat them.

002:013 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she
        burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her
        earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and
        forgat me, saith the LORD.

002:014 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
        wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

002:015 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley
        of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in
        the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out
        of the land of Egypt.

002:016 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt
        call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

002:017 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and
        they shall no more be remembered by their name.

002:018 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the
        beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the
        creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and
        the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them
        to lie down safely.

002:019 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
        thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in
        lovingkindness, and in mercies.

002:020 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou
        shalt know the LORD.

002:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the
        LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

002:022 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;
        and they shall hear Jezreel.

002:023 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
        upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them
        which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall
        say, Thou art my God.

003:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
        her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the
        LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods,
        and love flagons of wine.

003:002 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
        homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

003:003 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou
        shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another
        man: so will I also be for thee.

003:004 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
        king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and
        without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:

003:005 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
        LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD
        and his goodness in the latter days.

004:001 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD
        hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
        there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
        land.

004:002 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and
        committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

004:003 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
        therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with
        the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be
        taken away.

004:004 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are
        as they that strive with the priest.

004:005 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also
        shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy
        mother.

004:006 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou
        hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou
        shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law
        of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

004:007 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore
        will I change their glory into shame.

004:008 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
        their iniquity.

004:009 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will
        punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.

004:010 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
        whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off
        to take heed to the LORD.

004:011 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

004:012 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff
        declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused
        them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their
        God.

004:013 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn
        incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,
        because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters
        shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.

004:014 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,
        nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are
        separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots:
        therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.

004:015 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah
        offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to
        Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.

004:016 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD
        will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

004:017 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

004:018 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
        her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

004:019 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be
        ashamed because of their sacrifices.

005:001 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and
        give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you,
        because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon
        Tabor.

005:002 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I
        have been a rebuker of them all.

005:003 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O
        Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.

005:004 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for
        the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have
        not known the LORD.

005:005 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore
        shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also
        shall fall with them.

005:006 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek
        the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn
        himself from them.

005:007 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have
        begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with
        their portions.

005:008 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry
        aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

005:009 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the
        tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.

005:010 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
        therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

005:011 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he
        willingly walked after the commandment.

005:012 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house
        of Judah as rottenness.

005:013 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then
        went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet
        could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.

005:014 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to
        the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will
        take away, and none shall rescue him.

005:015 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
        offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek
        me early.

006:001 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and
        he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

006:002 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will
        raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

006:003 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his
        going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto
        us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

006:004 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do
        unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the
        early dew it goeth away.

006:005 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them
        by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light
        that goeth forth.

006:006 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of
        God more than burnt offerings.

006:007 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have
        they dealt treacherously against me.

006:008 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted
        with blood.

006:009 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of
        priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit
        lewdness.

006:010 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is
        the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

006:011 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I
        returned the captivity of my people.

007:001 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim
        was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit
        falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers
        spoileth without.

007:002 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all
        their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about;
        they are before my face.

007:003 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
        with their lies.

007:004 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
        ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it
        be leavened.

007:005 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with
        bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

007:006 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they
        lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the
        morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

007:007 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges;
        all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that
        calleth unto me.

007:008 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a
        cake not turned.

007:009 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not:
        yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth
        not.

007:010 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do
        not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

007:011 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
        Egypt, they go to Assyria.

007:012 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will
        bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise
        them, as their congregation hath heard.

007:013 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto
        them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have
        redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

007:014 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they
        howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and
        wine, and they rebel against me.

007:015 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they
        imagine mischief against me.

007:016 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a
        deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the
        rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land
        of Egypt.

008:001 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle
        against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed
        my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

008:002 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

008:003 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall
        pursue him.

008:004 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes,
        and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they
        made them idols, that they may be cut off.

008:005 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled
        against them: how long will it be ere they attain to
        innocency?

008:006 For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it
        is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

008:007 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the
        whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if
        so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.

008:008 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles
        as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.

008:009 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
        Ephraim hath hired lovers.

008:010 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I
        gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of
        the king of princes.

008:011 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be
        unto him to sin.

008:012 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they
        were counted as a strange thing.

008:013 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
        eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember
        their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to
        Egypt.

008:014 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
        Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire
        upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

009:001 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast
        gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon
        every cornfloor.

009:002 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new
        wine shall fail in her.

009:003 They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall
        return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.

009:004 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall
        they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them
        as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be
        polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into
        the house of the LORD.

009:005 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast
        of the LORD?

009:006 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall
        gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places
        for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be
        in their tabernacles.

009:007 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are
        come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the
        spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and
        the great hatred.

009:008 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a
        snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of
        his God.

009:009 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of
        Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will
        visit their sins.

009:010 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your
        fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:
        but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that
        shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.

009:011 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from
        the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.

009:012 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
        that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when
        I depart from them!

009:013 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but
        Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.

009:014 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a
        miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

009:015 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for
        the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine
        house, I will love them no more: all their princes are
        revolters.

009:016 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no
        fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the
        beloved fruit of their womb.

009:017 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto
        him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

010:001 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
        according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the
        altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made
        goodly images.

010:002 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he
        shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

010:003 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not
        the LORD; what then should a king do to us?

010:004 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant:
        thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the
        field.

010:005 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
        Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the
        priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof,
        because it is departed from it.

010:006 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
        Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be
        ashamed of his own counsel.

010:007 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the
        water.

010:008 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be
        destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their
        altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to
        the hills, Fall on us.

010:009 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they
        stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity
        did not overtake them.

010:010 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people
        shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind
        themselves in their two furrows.

010:011 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to
        tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I
        will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall
        break his clods.

010:012 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up
        your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he
        come and rain righteousness upon you.

010:013 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
        eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way,
        in the multitude of thy mighty men.

010:014 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
        fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in
        the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her
        children.

010:015 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness:
        in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

011:001 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son
        out of Egypt.

011:002 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed
        unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

011:003 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but
        they knew not that I healed them.

011:004 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was
        to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I
        laid meat unto them.

011:005 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian
        shall be his king, because they refused to return.

011:006 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his
        branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.

011:007 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they
        called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.

011:008 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,
        Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee
        as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are
        kindled together.

011:009 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
        return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy
        One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

011:010 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion:
        when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the
        west.

011:011 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out
        of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses,
        saith the LORD.

011:012 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel
        with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful
        with the saints.

012:001 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he
        daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a
        covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

012:002 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish
        Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he
        recompense him.

012:003 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his
        strength he had power with God:

012:004 Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and
        made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there
        he spake with us;

012:005 Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

012:006 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and
        wait on thy God continually.

012:007 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
        loveth to oppress.

012:008 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
        substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in
        me that were sin.

012:009 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
        make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the
        solemn feast.

012:010 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
        visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the
        prophets.

012:011 Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they
        sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps
        in the furrows of the fields.

012:012 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served
        for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

012:013 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by
        a prophet was he preserved.

012:014 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall
        he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD
        return unto him.

013:001 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel;
        but when he offended in Baal, he died.

013:002 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten
        images of their silver, and idols according to their own
        understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say
        of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.

013:003 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early
        dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the
        whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the
        chimney.

013:004 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou
        shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.

013:005 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great
        drought.

013:006 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were
        filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they
        forgotten me.

013:007 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the
        way will I observe them:

013:008 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and
        will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour
        them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.

013:009 O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine
        help.

013:010 I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in
        all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a
        king and princes?

013:011 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my
        wrath.

013:012 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

013:013 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is
        an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the
        breaking forth of children.

013:014 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
        them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I
        will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine
        eyes.

013:015 Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall
        come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness,
        and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be
        dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

013:016 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against
        her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be
        dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped
        up.

014:001 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen
        by thine iniquity.

014:002 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
        away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we
        render the calves of our lips.

014:003 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses:
        neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are
        our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

014:004 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for
        mine anger is turned away from him.

014:005 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily,
        and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

014:006 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the
        olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

014:007 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall
        revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof
        shall be as the wine of Lebanon.

014:008 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I
        have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree.
        From me is thy fruit found.

014:009 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent,
        and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right,
        and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall
        fall therein.

Book 29	Joel

001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

001:002 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
        land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your
        fathers?

001:003 Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their
        children, and their children another generation.

001:004 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and
        that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and
        that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller
        eaten.

001:005 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of
        wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your
        mouth.

001:006 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without
        number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the
        cheek teeth of a great lion.

001:007 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath
        made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are
        made white.

001:008 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of
        her youth.

001:009 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the
        house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.

001:010 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is
        wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

001:011 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for
        the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field
        is perished.

001:012 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the
        pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even
        all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is
        withered away from the sons of men.

001:013 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of
        the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of
        my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is
        withholden from the house of your God.

001:014 Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders
        and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD
        your God, and cry unto the LORD,

001:015 Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a
        destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

001:016 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness
        from the house of our God?

001:017 The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid
        desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.

001:018 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,
        because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are
        made desolate.

001:019 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the
        pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the
        trees of the field.

001:020 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of
        waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures
        of the wilderness.

002:001 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
        mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the
        day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;

002:002 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of
        thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a
        great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like,
        neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many
        generations.

002:003 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth:
        the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them
        a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

002:004 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as
        horsemen, so shall they run.

002:005 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
        leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the
        stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.

002:006 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces
        shall gather blackness.

002:007 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like
        men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and
        they shall not break their ranks:

002:008 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in
        his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be
        wounded.

002:009 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the
        wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in
        at the windows like a thief.

002:010 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble:
        the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall
        withdraw their shining:

002:011 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his
        camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word:
        for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who
        can abide it?

002:012 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with
        all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
        mourning:

002:013 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
        LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger,
        and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

002:014 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
        behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the
        LORD your God?

002:015 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn
        assembly:

002:016 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the
        elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts:
        let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out
        of her closet.

002:017 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the
        porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O
        LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the
        heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among
        the people, Where is their God?

002:018 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his
        people.

002:019 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I
        will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be
        satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach
        among the heathen:

002:020 But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will
        drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face
        toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost
        sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall
        come up, because he hath done great things.

002:021 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do
        great things.

002:022 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
        wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig
        tree and the vine do yield their strength.

002:023 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD
        your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately,
        and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former
        rain, and the latter rain in the first month.

002:024 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall
        overflow with wine and oil.

002:025 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath
        eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the
        palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.

002:026 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the
        name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with
        you: and my people shall never be ashamed.

002:027 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I
        am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never
        be ashamed.

002:028 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my
        spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall
        prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men
        shall see visions:

002:029 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those
        days will I pour out my spirit.

002:030 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth,
        blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

002:031 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
        blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

002:032 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the
        name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in
        Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in
        the remnant whom the LORD shall call.

003:001 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall
        bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

003:002 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into
        the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for
        my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered
        among the nations, and parted my land.

003:003 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy
        for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might
        drink.

003:004 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and
        all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence?
        and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return
        your recompence upon your own head;

003:005 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried
        into your temples my goodly pleasant things:

003:006 The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have
        ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from
        their border.

003:007 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have
        sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:

003:008 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of
        the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the
        Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.

003:009 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the
        mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come
        up:

003:010 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into
        spears: let the weak say, I am strong.

003:011 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather
        yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones
        to come down, O LORD.

003:012 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of
        Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen
        round about.

003:013 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you
        down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their
        wickedness is great.

003:014 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day
        of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.

003:015 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall
        withdraw their shining.

003:016 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from
        Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the
        LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the
        children of Israel.

003:017 So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion,
        my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there
        shall no strangers pass through her any more.

003:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains
        shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk,
        and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a
        fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and
        shall water the valley of Shittim.

003:019 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate
        wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah,
        because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

003:020 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation
        to generation.

003:021 For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for
        the LORD dwelleth in Zion.

Book 30	Amos

001:001 The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which
        he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah,
        and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel,
        two years before the earthquake.

001:002 And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice
        from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall
        mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.

001:003 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:

001:004 But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall
        devour the palaces of Benhadad.

001:005 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the
        inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the
        sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall
        go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.

001:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them
        up to Edom:

001:007 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour
        the palaces thereof:

001:008 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that
        holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand
        against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall
        perish, saith the Lord GOD.

001:009 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered
        not the brotherly covenant:

001:010 But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall
        devour the palaces thereof.

001:011 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he
        did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all
        pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his
        wrath for ever:

001:012 But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the
        palaces of Bozrah.

001:013 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children
        of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment
        thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of
        Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:

001:014 But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall
        devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of
        battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:

001:015 And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes
        together, saith the LORD.

002:001 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he
        burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:

002:002 But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the
        palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with
        shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:

002:003 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will
        slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.

002:004 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his
        commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the
        which their fathers have walked:

002:005 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the
        palaces of Jerusalem.

002:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of
        shoes;

002:007 That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
        and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father
        will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:

002:008 And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by
        every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the
        house of their god.

002:009 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like
        the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I
        destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

002:010 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you
        forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the
        Amorite.

002:011 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young
        men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of
        Israel? saith the LORD.

002:012 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the
        prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

002:013 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is
        full of sheaves.

002:014 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the
        strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the
        mighty deliver himself:

002:015 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is
        swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that
        rideth the horse deliver himself.

002:016 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away
        naked in that day, saith the LORD.

003:001 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O
        children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought
        up from the land of Egypt, saying,

003:002 You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
        therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.

003:003 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

003:004 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a
        young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?

003:005 Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for
        him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken
        nothing at all?

003:006 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be
        afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not
        done it?

003:007 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his
        secret unto his servants the prophets.

003:008 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath
        spoken, who can but prophesy?

003:009 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the
        land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains
        of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof,
        and the oppressed in the midst thereof.

003:010 For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up
        violence and robbery in their palaces.

003:011 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be
        even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy
        strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.

003:012 Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth
        of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the
        children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the
        corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.

003:013 Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord
        GOD, the God of hosts,

003:014 That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of
        Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and
        the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the
        ground.

003:015 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and
        the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall
        have an end, saith the LORD.

004:001 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of
        Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which
        say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.

004:002 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days
        shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks,
        and your posterity with fishhooks.

004:003 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which
        is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith
        the LORD.

004:004 Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply
        transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and
        your tithes after three years:

004:005 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and
        proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you,
        O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

004:006 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your
        cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not
        returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:007 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were
        yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon
        one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one
        piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not
        withered.

004:008 So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water;
        but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me,
        saith the LORD.

004:009 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens
        and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees
        increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not
        returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:010 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of
        Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have
        taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your
        camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned
        unto me, saith the LORD.

004:011 I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and
        Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the
        burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:012 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I
        will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

004:013 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,
        and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the
        morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the
        earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.

005:001 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a
        lamentation, O house of Israel.

005:002 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
        forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.

005:003 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a
        thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by
        an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.

005:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me,
        and ye shall live:

005:005 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
        Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and
        Bethel shall come to nought.

005:006 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire
        in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to
        quench it in Bethel.

005:007 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness
        in the earth,

005:008 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth
        the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
        with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and
        poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his
        name:

005:009 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the
        spoiled shall come against the fortress.

005:010 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him
        that speaketh uprightly.

005:011 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye
        take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn
        stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted
        pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.

005:012 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins:
        they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside
        the poor in the gate from their right.

005:013 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it
        is an evil time.

005:014 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD,
        the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

005:015 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in
        the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be
        gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.

005:016 Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus;
        Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the
        highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to
        mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.

005:017 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through
        thee, saith the LORD.

005:018 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is
        it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.

005:019 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went
        into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent
        bit him.

005:020 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even
        very dark, and no brightness in it?

005:021 I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in
        your solemn assemblies.

005:022 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I
        will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace
        offerings of your fat beasts.

005:023 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
        hear the melody of thy viols.

005:024 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
        mighty stream.

005:025 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
        wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

005:026 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your
        images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

005:027 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond
        Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.

006:001 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the
        mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to
        whom the house of Israel came!

006:002 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath
        the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they
        better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your
        border?

006:003 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of
        violence to come near;

006:004 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their
        couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves
        out of the midst of the stall;

006:005 That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves
        instruments of musick, like David;

006:006 That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief
        ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of
        Joseph.

006:007 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go
        captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves
        shall be removed.

006:008 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of
        hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces:
        therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.

006:009 And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one
        house, that they shall die.

006:010 And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him,
        to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto
        him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with
        thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy
        tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.

006:011 For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great
        house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

006:012 Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen?
        for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of
        righteousness into hemlock:

006:013 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not
        taken to us horns by our own strength?

006:014 But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of
        Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall
        afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of
        the wilderness.

007:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed
        grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter
        growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's
        mowings.

007:002 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating
        the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I
        beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

007:003 The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

007:004 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord
        GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep,
        and did eat up a part.

007:005 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall
        Jacob arise? for he is small.

007:006 The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the
        Lord GOD.

007:007 Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall
        made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

007:008 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said,
        A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a
        plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again
        pass by them any more:

007:009 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the
        sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise
        against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

007:010 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
        Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst
        of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his
        words.

007:011 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and
        Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

007:012 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away
        into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy
        there:

007:013 But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the
        king's chapel, and it is the king's court.

007:014 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet,
        neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a
        gatherer of sycomore fruit:

007:015 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD
        said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

007:016 Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,
        Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the
        house of Isaac.

007:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in
        the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the
        sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt
        die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into
        captivity forth of his land.

008:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of
        summer fruit.

008:002 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of
        summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon
        my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.

008:003 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day,
        saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every
        place; they shall cast them forth with silence.

008:004 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the
        poor of the land to fail,

008:005 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn?
        and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah
        small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by
        deceit?

008:006 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair
        of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

008:007 The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will
        never forget any of their works.

008:008 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that
        dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and
        it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

008:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD,
        that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will
        darken the earth in the clear day:

008:010 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs
        into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all
        loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the
        mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.

008:011 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a
        famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for
        water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:

008:012 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even
        to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the
        LORD, and shall not find it.

008:013 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for
        thirst.

008:014 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O
        Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they
        shall fall, and never rise up again.

009:001 I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the
        lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in
        the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with
        the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he
        that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.

009:002 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them;
        though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

009:003 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will
        search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from
        my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the
        serpent, and he shall bite them:

009:004 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence
        will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will
        set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.

009:005 And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it
        shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it
        shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by
        the flood of Egypt.

009:006 It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath
        founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters
        of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth:
        The LORD is his name.

009:007 Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children
        of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of
        the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the
        Syrians from Kir?

009:008 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom,
        and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving
        that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the
        LORD.

009:009 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel
        among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet
        shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.

009:010 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which
        say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.

009:011 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is
        fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up
        his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:

009:012 That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the
        heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that
        doeth this.

009:013 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall
        overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth
        seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the
        hills shall melt.

009:014 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel,
        and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and
        they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they
        shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

009:015 And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more
        be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith
        the LORD thy God.

Book 31	Obadiah

001:001 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
        Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador
        is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up
        against her in battle.

001:002 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
        greatly despised.

001:003 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
        dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;
        that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the
        ground?

001:004 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set
        thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
        the LORD.

001:005 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou
        cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if
        the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some
        grapes?

001:006 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden
        things sought up!

001:007 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the
        border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
        thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have
        laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.

001:008 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
        men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

001:009 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
        that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by
        slaughter.

001:010 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
        thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

001:011 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
        that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and
        foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
        Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.

001:012 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother
        in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou
        have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
        destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the
        day of distress.

001:013 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
        the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
        on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have
        laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;

001:014 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off
        those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have
        delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
        distress.

001:015 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou
        hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return
        upon thine own head.

001:016 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
        heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they
        shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not
        been.

001:017 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
        holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
        possessions.

001:018 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
        Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they
        shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be
        any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken
        it.

001:019 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and
        they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the
        fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin
        shall possess Gilead.

001:020 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
        possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
        captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess
        the cities of the south.

001:021 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
        Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

Book 32	Jonah

001:001 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
        saying,

001:002 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for
        their wickedness is come up before me.

001:003 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of
        the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to
        Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it,
        to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.

001:004 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was
        a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be
        broken.

001:005 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his
        god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the
        sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the
        sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

001:006 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest
        thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God
        will think upon us, that we perish not.

001:007 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast
        lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.
        So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

001:008 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose
        cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and
        whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people
        art thou?

001:009 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD,
        the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.

001:010 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why
        hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the
        presence of the LORD, because he had told them.

001:011 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the
        sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was
        tempestuous.

001:012 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the
        sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my
        sake this great tempest is upon you.

001:013 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but
        they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
        against them.

001:014 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee,
        O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's
        life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD,
        hast done as it pleased thee.

001:015 So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and
        the sea ceased from her raging.

001:016 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a
        sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.

001:017 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
        And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three
        nights.

002:001 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's
        belly,

002:002 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
        and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou
        heardest my voice.

002:003 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the
        seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and
        thy waves passed over me.

002:004 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again
        toward thy holy temple.

002:005 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth
        closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

002:006 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with
        her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my
        life from corruption, O LORD my God.

002:007 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my
        prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

002:008 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

002:009 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
        I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

002:010 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
        upon the dry land.

003:001 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time,
        saying,

003:002 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it
        the preaching that I bid thee.

003:003 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word
        of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three
        days' journey.

003:004 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
        cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
        overthrown.

003:005 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
        and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the
        least of them.

003:006 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
        throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with
        sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

003:007 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through
        Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
        neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let
        them not feed, nor drink water:

003:008 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
        mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil
        way, and from the violence that is in their hands.

003:009 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from
        his fierce anger, that we perish not?

003:010 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way;
        and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
        do unto them; and he did it not.

004:001 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

004:002 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD,
        was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
        Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou
        art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
        kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

004:003 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;
        for it is better for me to die than to live.

004:004 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

004:005 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the
        city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
        shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.

004:006 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
        Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him
        from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

004:007 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day,
        and it smote the gourd that it withered.

004:008 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared
        a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
        that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is
        better for me to die than to live.

004:009 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the
        gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.

004:010 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
        which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which
        came up in a night, and perished in a night:

004:011 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
        more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern
        between their right hand and their left hand; and also much
        cattle?

Book 33	Micah

001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the
        days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he
        saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

001:002 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein
        is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from
        his holy temple.

001:003 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will
        come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.

001:004 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys
        shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that
        are poured down a steep place.

001:005 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins
        of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is
        it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are
        they not Jerusalem?

001:006 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as
        plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones
        thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations
        thereof.

001:007 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
        and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and
        all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it
        of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of
        an harlot.

001:008 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked:
        I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the
        owls.

001:009 For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is
        come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

001:010 Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of
        Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

001:011 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame
        naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning
        of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.

001:012 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but
        evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

001:013 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift
        beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of
        Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

001:014 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the
        houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

001:015 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah:
        he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

001:016 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children;
        enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into
        captivity from thee.

002:001 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their
        beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it
        is in the power of their hand.

002:002 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses,
        and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even
        a man and his heritage.

002:003 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do
        I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;
        neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.

002:004 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and
        lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly
        spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he
        removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.

002:005 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot
        in the congregation of the LORD.

002:006 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall
        not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.

002:007 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the
        LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good
        to him that walketh uprightly?

002:008 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off
        the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as
        men averse from war.

002:009 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant
        houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for
        ever.

002:010 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
        polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

002:011 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I
        will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall
        even be the prophet of this people.

002:012 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
        gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the
        sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they
        shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.

002:013 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and
        have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and
        their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of
        them.

003:001 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes
        of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?

003:002 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin
        from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

003:003 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
        off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces,
        as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

003:004 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them:
        he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they
        have behaved themselves ill in their doings.

003:005 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my
        people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he
        that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war
        against him.

003:006 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a
        vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not
        divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the
        day shall be dark over them.

003:007 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
        yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer
        of God.

003:008 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of
        judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his
        transgression, and to Israel his sin.

003:009 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and
        princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and
        pervert all equity.

003:010 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

003:011 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof
        teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet
        will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among
        us? none evil can come upon us.

003:012 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and
        Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as
        the high places of the forest.

004:001 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain
        of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of
        the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and
        people shall flow unto it.

004:002 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
        to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of
        Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in
        his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of
        the LORD from Jerusalem.

004:003 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong
        nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into
        plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall
        not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn
        war any more.

004:004 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
        tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the
        LORD of hosts hath spoken it.

004:005 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and
        we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and
        ever.

004:006 In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth,
        and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have
        afflicted;

004:007 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was
        cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over
        them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.

004:008 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the
        daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first
        dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

004:009 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is
        thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman
        in travail.

004:010 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,
        like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of
        the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go
        even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD
        shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.

004:011 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let
        her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

004:012 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand
        they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into
        the floor.

004:013 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine
        horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt
        beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain
        unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
        earth.

005:001 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath
        laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel
        with a rod upon the cheek.

005:002 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
        thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
        me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
        from of old, from everlasting.

005:003 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
        travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his
        brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.

005:004 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in
        the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall
        abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

005:005 And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come
        into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then
        shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight
        principal men.

005:006 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and
        the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he
        deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land,
        and when he treadeth within our borders.

005:007 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people
        as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that
        tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.

005:008 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the
        midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest,
        as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go
        through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none
        can deliver.

005:009 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all
        thine enemies shall be cut off.

005:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I
        will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will
        destroy thy chariots:

005:011 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all
        thy strong holds:

005:012 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou
        shalt have no more soothsayers:

005:013 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images
        out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the
        work of thine hands.

005:014 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so
        will I destroy thy cities.

005:015 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the
        heathen, such as they have not heard.

006:001 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before
        the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

006:002 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong
        foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with
        his people, and he will plead with Israel.

006:003 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I
        wearied thee? testify against me.

006:004 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
        thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee
        Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

006:005 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted,
        and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto
        Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.

006:006 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before
        the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
        with calves of a year old?

006:007 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
        thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my
        transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

006:008 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the
        LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
        to walk humbly with thy God?

006:009 The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom
        shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed
        it.

006:010 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
        wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?

006:011 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the
        bag of deceitful weights?

006:012 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the
        inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is
        deceitful in their mouth.

006:013 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in
        making thee desolate because of thy sins.

006:014 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down
        shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but
        shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give
        up to the sword.

006:015 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the
        olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet
        wine, but shalt not drink wine.

006:016 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the
        house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should
        make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an
        hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

007:001 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer
        fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no
        cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

007:002 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none
        upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt
        every man his brother with a net.

007:003 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
        asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man,
        he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

007:004 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper
        than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation
        cometh; now shall be their perplexity.

007:005 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:
        keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

007:006 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
        against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in
        law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.

007:007 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God
        of my salvation: my God will hear me.

007:008 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall
        arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto
        me.

007:009 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned
        against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for
        me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold
        his righteousness.

007:010 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall
        cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine
        eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the
        mire of the streets.

007:011 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall
        the decree be far removed.

007:012 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and
        from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the
        river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.

007:013 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them
        that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.

007:014 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,
        which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel:
        let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

007:015 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt
        will I shew unto him marvellous things.

007:016 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might:
        they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall
        be deaf.

007:017 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out
        of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid
        of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.

007:018 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
        passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
        he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in
        mercy.

007:019 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will
        subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into
        the depths of the sea.

007:020 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to
        Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days
        of old.

Book 34	Nahum

001:001 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
        Elkoshite.

001:002 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
        and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his
        adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.

001:003 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
        all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind
        and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

001:004 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
        rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of
        Lebanon languisheth.

001:005 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth
        is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell
        therein.

001:006 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
        fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and
        the rocks are thrown down by him.

001:007 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
        knoweth them that trust in him.

001:008 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
        place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

001:009 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter
        end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.

001:010 For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they
        are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble
        fully dry.

001:011 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the
        LORD, a wicked counsellor.

001:012 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many,
        yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through.
        Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

001:013 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst
        thy bonds in sunder.

001:014 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no
        more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I
        cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy
        grave; for thou art vile.

001:015 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
        tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn
        feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass
        through thee; he is utterly cut off.

002:001 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the
        munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy
        power mightily.

002:002 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
        excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out,
        and marred their vine branches.

002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are
        in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the
        day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly
        shaken.

002:004 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one
        against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like
        torches, they shall run like the lightnings.

002:005 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their
        walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the
        defence shall be prepared.

002:006 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall
        be dissolved.

002:007 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up,
        and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves,
        tabering upon their breasts.

002:008 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall
        flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look
        back.

002:009 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there
        is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant
        furniture.

002:010 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and
        the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and
        the faces of them all gather blackness.

002:011 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of
        the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked,
        and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

002:012 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and
        strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey,
        and his dens with ravin.

002:013 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will
        burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy
        young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and
        the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.

003:001 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery;
        the prey departeth not;

003:002 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the
        wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping
        chariots.

003:003 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the
        glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a
        great number of carcases; and there is none end of their
        corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:

003:004 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
        harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations
        through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

003:005 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
        discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations
        thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

003:006 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee
        vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.

003:007 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee
        shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will
        bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?

003:008 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the
        rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was
        the sea, and her wall was from the sea?

003:009 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put
        and Lubim were thy helpers.

003:010 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
        children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
        streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all
        her great men were bound in chains.

003:011 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt
        seek strength because of the enemy.

003:012 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the
        firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into
        the mouth of the eater.

003:013 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates
        of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the
        fire shall devour thy bars.

003:014 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go
        into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

003:015 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee
        off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself
        many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.

003:016 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
        the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.

003:017 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
        grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but
        when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not
        known where they are.

003:018 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall
        dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
        and no man gathereth them.

003:019 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all
        that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee:
        for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

Book 35	Habakkuk

001:001 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

001:002 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry
        out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

001:003 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold
        grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there
        are that raise up strife and contention.

001:004 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go
        forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
        therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

001:005 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder
        marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will
        not believe, though it be told you.

001:006 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
        nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
        possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.

001:007 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
        dignity shall proceed of themselves.

001:008 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
        fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall
        spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far;
        they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.

001:009 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as
        the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the
        sand.

001:010 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a
        scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
        shall heap dust, and take it.

001:011 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and
        offend, imputing this his power unto his god.

001:012 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
        we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for
        judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for
        correction.

001:013 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look
        on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
        treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked
        devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?

001:014 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
        things, that have no ruler over them?

001:015 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in
        their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they
        rejoice and are glad.

001:016 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto
        their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their
        meat plenteous.

001:017 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare
        continually to slay the nations?

002:001 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and
        will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall
        answer when I am reproved.

002:002 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make
        it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

002:003 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it
        shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
        because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

002:004 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but
        the just shall live by his faith.

002:005 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,
        neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and
        is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him
        all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:

002:006 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a
        taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that
        increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that
        ladeth himself with thick clay!

002:007 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and
        awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto
        them?

002:008 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
        people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the
        violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell
        therein.

002:009 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,
        that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered
        from the power of evil!

002:010 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many
        people, and hast sinned against thy soul.

002:011 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of
        the timber shall answer it.

002:012 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a
        city by iniquity!

002:013 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall
        labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves
        for very vanity?

002:014 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory
        of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

002:015 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy
        bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest
        look on their nakedness!

002:016 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let
        thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand
        shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on
        thy glory.

002:017 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
        beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and
        for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that
        dwell therein.

002:018 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
        graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the
        maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

002:019 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone,
        Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and
        silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

002:020 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep
        silence before him.

003:001 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

003:002 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD,
        revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the
        years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

003:003 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
        His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his
        praise.

003:004 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out
        of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

003:005 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth
        at his feet.

003:006 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder
        the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the
        perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

003:007 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of
        the land of Midian did tremble.

003:008 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger
        against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou
        didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?

003:009 Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the
        tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
        rivers.

003:010 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of
        the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up
        his hands on high.

003:011 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light
        of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy
        glittering spear.

003:012 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
        thresh the heathen in anger.

003:013 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
        salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
        the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto
        the neck. Selah.

003:014 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
        villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their
        rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

003:015 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the
        heap of great waters.

003:016 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the
        voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
        myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he
        cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his
        troops.

003:017 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit
        be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the
        fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from
        the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:

003:018 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my
        salvation.

003:019 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like
        hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high
        places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

Book 36	Zephaniah

001:001 The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of
        Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of
        Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

001:002 I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the
        LORD.

001:003 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
        heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks
        with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land,
        saith the LORD.

001:004 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of
        Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the
        priests;

001:005 And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops;
        and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that
        swear by Malcham;

001:006 And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that
        have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.

001:007 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of
        the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice,
        he hath bid his guests.

001:008 And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice,
        that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and
        all such as are clothed with strange apparel.

001:009 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the
        threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and
        deceit.

001:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that
        there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an
        howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.

001:011 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people
        are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

001:012 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search
        Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on
        their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do
        good, neither will he do evil.

001:013 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a
        desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit
        them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine
        thereof.

001:014 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth
        greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man
        shall cry there bitterly.

001:015 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a
        day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and
        gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

001:016 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and
        against the high towers.

001:017 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like
        blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and
        their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as
        the dung.

001:018 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver
        them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall
        be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make
        even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

002:001 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
        desired;

002:002 Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the
        chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you,
        before the day of the LORD's anger come upon you.

002:003 Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought
        his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye
        shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger.

002:004 For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they
        shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be
        rooted up.

002:005 Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the
        Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan,
        the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that
        there shall be no inhabitant.

002:006 And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for
        shepherds, and folds for flocks.

002:007 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah;
        they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall
        they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall
        visit them, and turn away their captivity.

002:008 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the
        children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and
        magnified themselves against their border.

002:009 Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
        Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of
        Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits,
        and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall
        spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.

002:010 This shall they have for their pride, because they have
        reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the
        LORD of hosts.

002:011 The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all
        the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one
        from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.

002:012 Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.

002:013 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and
        destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry
        like a wilderness.

002:014 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts
        of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge
        in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the
        windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall
        uncover the cedar work.

002:015 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in
        her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she
        become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every
        one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

003:001 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing
        city!

003:002 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she
        trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

003:003 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are
        evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

003:004 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests
        have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the
        law.

003:005 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do
        iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light,
        he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.

003:006 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made
        their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are
        destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none
        inhabitant.

003:007 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive
        instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off,
        howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted
        all their doings.

003:008 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that
        I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the
        nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them
        mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth
        shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

003:009 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they
        may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one
        consent.

003:010 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the
        daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.

003:011 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
        wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will
        take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy
        pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy
        mountain.

003:012 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
        people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

003:013 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;
        neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for
        they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

003:014 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice
        with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

003:015 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine
        enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of
        thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.

003:016 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and
        to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.

003:017 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save,
        he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love,
        he will joy over thee with singing.

003:018 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
        who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.

003:019 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I
        will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven
        out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where
        they have been put to shame.

003:020 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I
        gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all
        people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before
        your eyes, saith the LORD.

Book 37	Haggai

001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
        the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by
        Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
        governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high
        priest, saying,

001:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The
        time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be
        built.

001:003 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

001:004 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and
        this house lie waste?

001:005 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
        ways.

001:006 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
        not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
        clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
        earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

001:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

001:008 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
        and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
        the LORD.

001:009 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye
        brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
        hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every
        man unto his own house.

001:010 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
        earth is stayed from her fruit.

001:011 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
        mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon
        the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and
        upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
        hands.

001:012 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
        Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
        obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of
        Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and
        the people did fear before the LORD.

001:013 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message
        unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

001:014 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
        Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
        of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
        remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house
        of the LORD of hosts, their God,

001:015 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the
        second year of Darius the king.

002:001 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the
        month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai,
        saying,

002:002 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
        Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and
        to the residue of the people, saying,

002:003 Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory?
        and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison
        of it as nothing?

002:004 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be
        strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be
        strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work:
        for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

002:005 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came
        out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

002:006 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little
        while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
        sea, and the dry land;

002:007 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
        shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the
        LORD of hosts.

002:008 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

002:009 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
        former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give
        peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

002:010 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the
        second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
        prophet, saying,

002:011 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning
        the law, saying,

002:012 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with
        his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any
        meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

002:013 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch
        any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered
        and said, It shall be unclean.

002:014 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is
        this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of
        their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.

002:015 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from
        before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the
        LORD:

002:016 Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty
        measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat
        for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but
        twenty.

002:017 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
        the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the
        LORD.

002:018 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and
        twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the
        foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.

002:019 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
        tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not
        brought forth: from this day will I bless you.

002:020 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four
        and twentieth day of the month, saying,

002:021 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake
        the heavens and the earth;

002:022 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will
        destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I
        will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and
        the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the
        sword of his brother.

002:023 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O
        Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD,
        and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

Book 38	Zechariah

001:001 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the
        word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo the prophet, saying,

001:002 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.

001:003 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
        Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto
        you, saith the LORD of hosts.

001:004 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have
        cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from
        your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not
        hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.

001:005 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live
        for ever?

001:006 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants
        the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they
        returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do
        unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings,
        so hath he dealt with us.

001:007 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
        is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the
        word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo the prophet, saying,

001:008 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and
        he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and
        behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.

001:009 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that
        talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.

001:010 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
        said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and
        fro through the earth.

001:011 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the
        myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the
        earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at
        rest.

001:012 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,
        how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the
        cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these
        threescore and ten years?

001:013 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good
        words and comfortable words.

001:014 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for
        Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

001:015 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
        ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped
        forward the affliction.

001:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with
        mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of
        hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.

001:017 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities
        through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD
        shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

001:018 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.

001:019 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these?
        And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered
        Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

001:020 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

001:021 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying,
        These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man
        did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast
        out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over
        the land of Judah to scatter it.

002:001 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with
        a measuring line in his hand.

002:002 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To
        measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and
        what is the length thereof.

002:003 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and
        another angel went out to meet him,

002:004 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,
        Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the
        multitude of men and cattle therein:

002:005 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round
        about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.

002:006 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith
        the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of
        the heaven, saith the LORD.

002:007 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
        Babylon.

002:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent
        me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth
        you toucheth the apple of his eye.

002:009 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall
        be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD
        of hosts hath sent me.

002:010 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I
        will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.

002:011 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and
        shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and
        thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.

002:012 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,
        and shall choose Jerusalem again.

002:013 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up
        out of his holy habitation.

003:001 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
        angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to
        resist him.

003:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan;
        even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not
        this a brand plucked out of the fire?

003:003 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before
        the angel.

003:004 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,
        saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him
        he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from
        thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.

003:005 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they
        set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.
        And the angel of the LORD stood by.

003:006 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,

003:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways,
        and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my
        house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee
        places to walk among these that stand by.

003:008 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that
        sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I
        will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.

003:009 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one
        stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving
        thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the
        iniquity of that land in one day.

003:010 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man
        his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.

004:001 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as
        a man that is wakened out of his sleep.

004:002 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked,
        and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top
        of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the
        seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:

004:003 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the
        bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.

004:004 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me,
        saying, What are these, my lord?

004:005 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me,
        Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

004:006 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word
        of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
        power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.

004:007 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
        become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof
        with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.

004:008 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

004:009 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this
        house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know
        that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

004:010 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall
        rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel
        with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to
        and fro through the whole earth.

004:011 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive
        trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left
        side thereof?

004:012 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two
        olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the
        golden oil out of themselves?

004:013 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be?
        And I said, No, my lord.

004:014 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by
        the LORD of the whole earth.

005:001 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold
        a flying roll.

005:002 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a
        flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the
        breadth thereof ten cubits.

005:003 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over
        the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall
        be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that
        sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.

005:004 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall
        enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him
        that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the
        midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber
        thereof and the stones thereof.

005:005 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto
        me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth
        forth.

005:006 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that
        goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance
        through all the earth.

005:007 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is
        a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.

005:008 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst
        of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth
        thereof.

005:009 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
        came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they
        had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the
        ephah between the earth and the heaven.

005:010 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these
        bear the ephah?

005:011 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of
        Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her
        own base.

006:001 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and,
        behold, there came four chariots out from between two
        mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.

006:002 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second
        chariot black horses;

006:003 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth
        chariot grisled and bay horses.

006:004 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me,
        What are these, my lord?

006:005 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four
        spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before
        the LORD of all the earth.

006:006 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north
        country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go
        forth toward the south country.

006:007 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk
        to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk
        to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro
        through the earth.

006:008 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold,
        these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit
        in the north country.

006:009 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

006:010 Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and
        of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the
        same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of
        Zephaniah;

006:011 Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon
        the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;

006:012 And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
        saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall
        grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the
        LORD:

006:013 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear
        the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he
        shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace
        shall be between them both.

006:014 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to
        Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in
        the temple of the LORD.

006:015 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple
        of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath
        sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will
        diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.

007:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that
        the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of
        the ninth month, even in Chisleu;

007:002 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and
        Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,

007:003 And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the
        LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in
        the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so
        many years?

007:004 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,

007:005 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,
        saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh
        month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me,
        even to me?

007:006 And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for
        yourselves, and drink for yourselves?

007:007 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the
        former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in
        prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men
        inhabited the south and the plain?

007:008 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,

007:009 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true
        judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his
        brother:

007:010 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger,
        nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his
        brother in your heart.

007:011 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and
        stopped their ears, that they should not hear.

007:012 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they
        should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts
        hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came
        a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.

007:013 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would
        not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD
        of hosts:

007:014 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
        whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them,
        that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the
        pleasant land desolate.

008:001 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,

008:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with
        great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.

008:003 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell
        in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a
        city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy
        mountain.

008:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old
        women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with
        his staff in his hand for very age.

008:005 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
        playing in the streets thereof.

008:006 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes
        of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be
        marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.

008:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people
        from the east country, and from the west country;

008:008 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of
        Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
        God, in truth and in righteousness.

008:009 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye
        that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the
        prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the
        house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be
        built.

008:010 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire
        for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or
        came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one
        against his neighbour.

008:011 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in
        the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.

008:012 For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her
        fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens
        shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this
        people to possess all these things.

008:013 And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the
        heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save
        you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands
        be strong.

008:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,
        when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of
        hosts, and I repented not:

008:015 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto
        Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.

008:016 These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the
        truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and
        peace in your gates:

008:017 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
        neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things
        that I hate, saith the LORD.

008:018 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,

008:019 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month,
        and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and
        the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and
        gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and
        peace.

008:020 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that
        there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:

008:021 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying,
        Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the
        LORD of hosts: I will go also.

008:022 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the
        LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.

008:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to
        pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the
        nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a
        Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God
        is with you.

009:001 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and
        Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as
        of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.

009:002 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though
        it be very wise.

009:003 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up
        silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

009:004 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her
        power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.

009:005 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and
        be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be
        ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon
        shall not be inhabited.

009:006 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the
        pride of the Philistines.

009:007 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his
        abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth,
        even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor
        in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

009:008 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army,
        because of him that passeth by, and because of him that
        returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more:
        for now have I seen with mine eyes.

009:009 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
        Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and
        having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a
        colt the foal of an ass.

009:010 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse
        from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he
        shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be
        from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of
        the earth.

009:011 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent
        forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.

009:012 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day
        do I declare that I will render double unto thee;

009:013 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim,
        and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece,
        and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.

009:014 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go
        forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the
        trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.

009:015 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour,
        and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a
        noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls,
        and as the corners of the altar.

009:016 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the
        flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a
        crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.

009:017 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!
        corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the
        maids.

010:001 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
        LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
        to every one grass in the field.

010:002 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
        lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain:
        therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled,
        because there was no shepherd.

010:003 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished
        the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the
        house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the
        battle.

010:004 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of
        him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.

010:005 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their
        enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they
        shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on
        horses shall be confounded.

010:006 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
        house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them;
        for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had
        not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear
        them.

010:007 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their
        heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall
        see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.

010:008 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed
        them: and they shall increase as they have increased.

010:009 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember
        me in far countries; and they shall live with their children,
        and turn again.

010:010 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and
        gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the
        land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for
        them.

010:011 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall
        smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river
        shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down,
        and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.

010:012 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up
        and down in his name, saith the LORD.

011:001 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy
        cedars.

011:002 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty
        are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the
        vintage is come down.

011:003 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their
        glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for
        the pride of Jordan is spoiled.

011:004 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

011:005 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty:
        and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am
        rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.

011:006 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
        LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his
        neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they
        shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver
        them.

011:007 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of
        the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called
        Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

011:008 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul
        lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.

011:009 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
        and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the
        rest eat every one the flesh of another.

011:010 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I
        might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.

011:011 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock
        that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.

011:012 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and
        if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of
        silver.

011:013 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
        price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty
        pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of
        the LORD.

011:014 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might
        break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

011:015 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments
        of a foolish shepherd.

011:016 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall
        not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young
        one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth
        still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their
        claws in pieces.

011:017 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword
        shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall
        be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly
        darkened.

012:001 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD,
        which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation
        of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.

012:002 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
        people round about, when they shall be in the siege both
        against Judah and against Jerusalem.

012:003 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
        all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in
        pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered
        together against it.

012:004 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with
        astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine
        eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of
        the people with blindness.

012:005 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
        inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of
        hosts their God.

012:006 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth
        of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf;
        and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right
        hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again
        in her own place, even in Jerusalem.

012:007 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the
        glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.

012:008 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of
        Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall
        be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the
        angel of the LORD before them.

012:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to
        destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

012:010 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of
        supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have
        pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his
        only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is
        in bitterness for his firstborn.

012:011 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as
        the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

012:012 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of
        the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of
        the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

012:013 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart;
        the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

012:014 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their
        wives apart.

013:001 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
        David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for
        uncleanness.

013:002 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of
        hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the
        land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will
        cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the
        land.

013:003 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy,
        then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto
        him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name
        of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him
        shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

013:004 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall
        be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied;
        neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:

013:005 But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man
        taught me to keep cattle from my youth.

013:006 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine
        hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in
        the house of my friends.

013:007 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that
        is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and
        the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon
        the little ones.

013:008 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the
        LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the
        third shall be left therein.

013:009 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will
        refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is
        tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I
        will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my
        God.

014:001 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be
        divided in the midst of thee.

014:002 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and
        the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women
        ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity,
        and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the
        city.

014:003 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations,
        as when he fought in the day of battle.

014:004 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
        which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives
        shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward
        the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of
        the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it
        toward the south.

014:005 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the
        valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall
        flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days
        of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and
        all the saints with thee.

014:006 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall
        not be clear, nor dark:

014:007 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not
        day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening
        time it shall be light.

014:008 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out
        from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half
        of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall
        it be.

014:009 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day
        shall there be one LORD, and his name one.

014:010 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon
        south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited
        in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first
        gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel
        unto the king's winepresses.

014:011 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
        destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.

014:012 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all
        the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh
        shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their
        eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall
        consume away in their mouth.

014:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult
        from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold
        every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall
        rise up against the hand of his neighbour.

014:014 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
        the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and
        silver, and apparel, in great abundance.

014:015 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
        camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in
        these tents, as this plague.

014:016 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all
        the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from
        year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to
        keep the feast of tabernacles.

014:017 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the
        families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the
        LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.

014:018 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have
        no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will
        smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of
        tabernacles.

014:019 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of
        all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

014:020 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
        HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall
        be like the bowls before the altar.

014:021 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness
        unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come
        and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there
        shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of
        hosts.

Book 39	Malachi

001:001 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.

001:002 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast
        thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD:
        yet I loved Jacob,

001:003 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage
        waste for the dragons of the wilderness.

001:004 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return
        and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts,
        They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call
        them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom
        the LORD hath indignation for ever.

001:005 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be
        magnified from the border of Israel.

001:006 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then
        I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master,
        where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests,
        that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy
        name?

001:007 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein
        have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD
        is contemptible.

001:008 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and
        if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now
        unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy
        person? saith the LORD of hosts.

001:009 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto
        us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons?
        saith the LORD of hosts.

001:010 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for
        nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I
        have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will
        I accept an offering at your hand.

001:011 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
        same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every
        place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure
        offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

001:012 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD
        is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is
        contemptible.

001:013 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have
        snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that
        which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an
        offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.

001:014 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male,
        and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for
        I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is
        dreadful among the heathen.

002:001 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.

002:002 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to
        give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even
        send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I
        have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.

002:003 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your
        faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take
        you away with it.

002:004 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you,
        that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

002:005 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to
        him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before
        my name.

002:006 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found
        in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did
        turn many away from iniquity.

002:007 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should
        seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD
        of hosts.

002:008 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to
        stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

002:009 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before
        all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but
        have been partial in the law.

002:010 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why
        do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by
        profaning the covenant of our fathers?

002:011 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is
        committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned
        the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the
        daughter of a strange god.

002:012 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and
        the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that
        offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.

002:013 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD
        with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that
        he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with
        good will at your hand.

002:014 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness
        between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast
        dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of
        thy covenant.

002:015 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
        And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore
        take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously
        against the wife of his youth.

002:016 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
        away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the
        LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye
        deal not treacherously.

002:017 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
        have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is
        good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or,
        Where is the God of judgment?

003:001 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way
        before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to
        his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye
        delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.

003:002 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
        when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like
        fullers' soap:

003:003 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he
        shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
        silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in
        righteousness.

003:004 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant
        unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

003:005 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
        witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and
        against false swearers, and against those that oppress the
        hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that
        turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

003:006 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob
        are not consumed.

003:007 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
        ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will
        return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein
        shall we return?

003:008 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein
        have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

003:009 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this
        whole nation.

003:010 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
        meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD
        of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and
        pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough
        to receive it.

003:011 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall
        not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine
        cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

003:012 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a
        delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.

003:013 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye
        say, What have we spoken so much against thee?

003:014 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it
        that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked
        mournfully before the LORD of hosts?

003:015 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work
        wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even
        delivered.

003:016 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and
        the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance
        was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that
        thought upon his name.

003:017 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day
        when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man
        spareth his own son that serveth him.

003:018 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and
        the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth
        him not.

004:001 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and
        all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be
        stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
        LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
        branch.

004:002 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness
        arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and
        grow up as calves of the stall.

004:003 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes
        under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

004:004 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
        unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and
        judgments.

004:005 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
        of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:

004:006 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
        and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come
        and smite the earth with a curse.

Book 40	Matthew

001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
        the son of Abraham.

001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
        Judas and his brethren;

001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
        Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
        Naasson begat Salmon;

001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
        and Obed begat Jesse;

001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
        Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
        begat Asa;

001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
        begat Ozias;

001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
        begat Ezekias;

001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
        begat Josias;

001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
        they were carried away to Babylon:

001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
        Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
        Eliakim begat Azor;

001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
        Eliud;

001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
        Matthan begat Jacob;

001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
        Jesus, who is called Christ.

001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
        generations; and from David until the carrying away into
        Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away
        into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
        mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
        she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
        make her a publick example, was minded to put her away
        privily.

001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
        LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
        David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
        which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
        JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
        spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
        son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
        interpreted is, God with us.

001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
        Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:
        and he called his name JESUS.

002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
        Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
        Jerusalem,

002:002 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
        seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

002:003 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
        and all Jerusalem with him.

002:004 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of
        the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should
        be born.

002:005 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
        written by the prophet,

002:006 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
        among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a
        Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

002:007 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired
        of them diligently what time the star appeared.

002:008 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search
        diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him,
        bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

002:009 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the
        star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it
        came and stood over where the young child was.

002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
        joy.

002:011 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
        child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
        and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto
        him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

002:012 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
        to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

002:013 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
        appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
        young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou
        there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young
        child to destroy him.

002:014 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
        night, and departed into Egypt:

002:015 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
        fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
        Out of Egypt have I called my son.

002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
        was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
        that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from
        two years old and under, according to the time which he had
        diligently enquired of the wise men.

002:017 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
        prophet, saying,

002:018 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and
        great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not
        be comforted, because they are not.

002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
        appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

002:020 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go
        into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the
        young child's life.

002:021 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
        came into the land of Israel.

002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the
        room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:
        notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned
        aside into the parts of Galilee:

002:023 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
        be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
        called a Nazarene.

003:001 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
        wilderness of Judaea,

003:002 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

003:003 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
        saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
        the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

003:004 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a
        leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and
        wild honey.

003:005 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the
        region round about Jordan,

003:006 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.

003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
        his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who
        hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

003:009 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
        father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
        to raise up children unto Abraham.

003:010 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
        therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is
        hewn down, and cast into the fire.

003:011 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
        cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not
        worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and
        with fire:

003:012 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
        floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn
        up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

003:013 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
        baptized of him.

003:014 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
        thee, and comest thou to me?

003:015 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for
        thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
        suffered him.

003:016 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
        the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he
        saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
        upon him:

003:017 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in
        whom I am well pleased.

004:001 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
        tempted of the devil.

004:002 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
        afterward an hungred.

004:003 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son
        of God, command that these stones be made bread.

004:004 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
        bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
        mouth of God.

004:005 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
        him on a pinnacle of the temple,

004:006 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
        down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
        concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up,
        lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

004:007 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
        the Lord thy God.

004:008 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
        mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and
        the glory of them;

004:009 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
        wilt fall down and worship me.

004:010 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
        written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
        shalt thou serve.

004:011 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
        ministered unto him.

004:012 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
        departed into Galilee;

004:013 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
        upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

004:014 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying,

004:015 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of
        the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

004:016 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them
        which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
        up.

004:017 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for
        the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

004:018 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
        Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into
        the sea: for they were fishers.

004:019 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers
        of men.

004:020 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.

004:021 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee
        their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

004:022 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and
        followed him.

004:023 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
        synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
        healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among
        the people.

004:024 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto
        him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and
        torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and
        those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and
        he healed them.

004:025 And there followed him great multitudes of people from
        Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from
        Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

005:001 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
        when he was set, his disciples came unto him:

005:002 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

005:003 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
        heaven.

005:004 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

005:005 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

005:006 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
        righteousness: for they shall be filled.

005:007 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
        children of God.

005:010 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:
        for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

005:011 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
        and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
        sake.

005:012 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
        heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
        you.

005:013 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
        savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
        for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
        of men.

005:014 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
        cannot be hid.

005:015 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but
        on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the
        house.

005:016 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
        good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

005:017 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
        I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

005:018 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
        or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
        fulfilled.

005:019 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
        commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the
        least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and
        teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
        heaven.

005:020 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
        exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
        shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

005:021 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt
        not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
        judgment:

005:022 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
        without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and
        whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger
        of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be
        in danger of hell fire.

005:023 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
        rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;

005:024 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first
        be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
        gift.

005:025 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
        with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
        judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be
        cast into prison.

005:026 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out
        thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

005:027 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
        not commit adultery:

005:028 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
        after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
        heart.

005:029 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it
        from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
        members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
        cast into hell.

005:030 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it
        from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
        members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
        cast into hell.

005:031 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
        give her a writing of divorcement:

005:032 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife,
        saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit
        adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
        committeth adultery.

005:033 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old
        time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto
        the Lord thine oaths:

005:034 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for
        it is God's throne:

005:035 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
        Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

005:036 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not
        make one hair white or black.

005:037 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for
        whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

005:038 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
        tooth for a tooth:

005:039 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever
        shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
        also.

005:040 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
        coat, let him have thy cloak also.

005:041 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him
        twain.

005:042 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow
        of thee turn not thou away.

005:043 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
        neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

005:044 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
        you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
        despitefully use you, and persecute you;

005:045 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:
        for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
        sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

005:046 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
        not even the publicans the same?

005:047 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
        others? do not even the publicans so?

005:048 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
        heaven is perfect.

006:001 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
        them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in
        heaven.

006:002 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
        before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
        streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto
        you, They have their reward.

006:003 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
        right hand doeth:

006:004 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth
        in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

006:005 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
        are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
        the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.
        Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

006:006 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
        thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
        secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee
        openly.

006:007 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:
        for they think that they shall be heard for their much
        speaking.

006:008 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
        what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

006:009 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
        heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

006:010 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
        heaven.

006:011 Give us this day our daily bread.

006:012 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

006:013 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For
        thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
        Amen.

006:014 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
        will also forgive you:

006:015 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
        Father forgive your trespasses.

006:016 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
        countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may
        appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
        their reward.

006:017 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
        face;

006:018 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
        which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret,
        shall reward thee openly.

006:019 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
        rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

006:020 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
        moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break
        through nor steal:

006:021 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

006:022 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
        single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

006:023 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
        darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness,
        how great is that darkness!

006:024 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
        and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
        despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

006:025 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what
        ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
        what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
        body than raiment?

006:026 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
        reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
        them. Are ye not much better than they?

006:027 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
        stature?

006:028 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
        the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

006:029 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was
        not arrayed like one of these.

006:030 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to
        day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
        more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

006:031 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What
        shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

006:032 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
        heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

006:033 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
        and all these things shall be added unto you.

006:034 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
        take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
        is the evil thereof.

007:001 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

007:002 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with
        what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

007:003 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
        but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

007:004 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote
        out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

007:005 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;
        and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of
        thy brother's eye.

007:006 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye
        your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their
        feet, and turn again and rend you.

007:007 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
        knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

007:008 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
        findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

007:009 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will
        he give him a stone?

007:010 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

007:011 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
        children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
        give good things to them that ask him?

007:012 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to
        you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
        prophets.

007:013 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and
        broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there
        be which go in thereat:

007:014 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
        leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

007:015 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
        clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

007:016 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
        thorns, or figs of thistles?

007:017 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a
        corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

007:018 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
        corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

007:019 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
        and cast into the fire.

007:020 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

007:021 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
        the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
        which is in heaven.

007:022 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
        prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils?
        and in thy name done many wonderful works?

007:023 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart
        from me, ye that work iniquity.

007:024 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
        them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
        upon a rock:

007:025 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
        blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was
        founded upon a rock.

007:026 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
        them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
        house upon the sand:

007:027 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
        blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the
        fall of it.

007:028 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
        people were astonished at his doctrine:

007:029 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the
        scribes.

008:001 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
        followed him.

008:002 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,
        Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

008:003 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will;
        be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

008:004 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy
        way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
        commanded, for a testimony unto them.

008:005 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him
        a centurion, beseeching him,

008:006 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
        grievously tormented.

008:007 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

008:008 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that
        thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only,
        and my servant shall be healed.

008:009 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and
        I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
        he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
        followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great
        faith, no, not in Israel.

008:011 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and
        west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
        in the kingdom of heaven.

008:012 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
        darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

008:013 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou
        hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was
        healed in the selfsame hour.

008:014 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's
        mother laid, and sick of a fever.

008:015 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she
        arose, and ministered unto them.

008:016 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
        possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his
        word, and healed all that were sick:

008:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
        sicknesses.

008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
        commandment to depart unto the other side.

008:019 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
        follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

008:020 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds
        of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to
        lay his head.

008:021 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me
        first to go and bury my father.

008:022 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury
        their dead.

008:023 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed
        him.

008:024 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
        that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

008:025 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord,
        save us: we perish.

008:026 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
        faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
        there was a great calm.

008:027 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this,
        that even the winds and the sea obey him!

008:028 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the
        Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming
        out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass
        by that way.

008:029 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
        thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment
        us before the time?

008:030 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine
        feeding.

008:031 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out,
        suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.

008:032 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they
        went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of
        swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
        perished in the waters.

008:033 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the
        city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the
        possessed of the devils.

008:034 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when
        they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of
        their coasts.

009:001 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his
        own city.

009:002 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy,
        lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the
        sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
        thee.

009:003 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
        This man blasphemeth.

009:004 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil
        in your hearts?

009:005 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
        to say, Arise, and walk?

009:006 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
        to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,)
        Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.

009:007 And he arose, and departed to his house.

009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified
        God, which had given such power unto men.

009:009 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
        Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto
        him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

009:010 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,
        behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him
        and his disciples.

009:011 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples,
        Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?

009:012 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be
        whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

009:013 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and
        not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
        sinners to repentance.

009:014 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and
        the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?

009:015 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
        mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days
        will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and
        then shall they fast.

009:016 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for
        that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment,
        and the rent is made worse.

009:017 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
        break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but
        they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

009:018 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
        certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even
        now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall
        live.

009:019 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

009:020 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of
        blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of
        his garment:

009:021 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
        shall be whole.

009:022 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
        Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
        And the woman was made whole from that hour.

009:023 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the
        minstrels and the people making a noise,

009:024 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
        sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

009:025 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her
        by the hand, and the maid arose.

009:026 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

009:027 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
        crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.

009:028 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to
        him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to
        do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.

009:029 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be
        it unto you.

009:030 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
        saying, See that no man know it.

009:031 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in
        all that country.

009:032 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
        possessed with a devil.

009:033 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the
        multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

009:034 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the
        prince of the devils.

009:035 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
        their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
        healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
        on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as
        sheep having no shepherd.

009:037 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is
        plenteous, but the labourers are few;

009:038 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send
        forth labourers into his harvest.

010:001 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
        them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to
        heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,
        Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

010:003 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;
        James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was
        Thaddaeus;

010:004 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
        him.

010:005 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go
        not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
        Samaritans enter ye not:

010:006 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

010:007 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
        hand.

010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
        devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

010:009 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

010:010 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes,
        nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

010:011 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who
        in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

010:012 And when ye come into an house, salute it.

010:013 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but
        if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

010:014 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
        ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of
        your feet.

010:015 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
        of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that
        city.

010:016 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be
        ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

010:017 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the
        councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

010:018 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my
        sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

010:019 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
        shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what
        ye shall speak.

010:020 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
        which speaketh in you.

010:021 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
        father the child: and the children shall rise up against their
        parents, and cause them to be put to death.

010:022 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
        that endureth to the end shall be saved.

010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
        another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone
        over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

010:024 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above
        his lord.

010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and
        the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the
        house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his
        household?

010:026 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that
        shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

010:027 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what
        ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

010:028 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
        kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy
        both soul and body in hell.

010:029 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them
        shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

010:030 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

010:031 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
        sparrows.

010:032 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
        confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

010:033 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
        before my Father which is in heaven.

010:034 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
        send peace, but a sword.

010:035 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
        the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law
        against her mother in law.

010:036 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

010:037 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
        me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
        worthy of me.

010:038 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is
        not worthy of me.

010:039 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his
        life for my sake shall find it.

010:040 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
        receiveth him that sent me.

010:041 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
        receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous
        man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous
        man's reward.

010:042 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
        ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple,
        verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

011:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding
        his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to
        preach in their cities.

011:002 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
        sent two of his disciples,

011:003 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look
        for another?

011:004 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again
        those things which ye do hear and see:

011:005 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
        are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and
        the poor have the gospel preached to them.

011:006 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

011:007 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
        concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
        A reed shaken with the wind?

011:008 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
        raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings'
        houses.

011:009 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto
        you, and more than a prophet.

011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
        messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before
        thee.

011:011 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
        hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
        notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is
        greater than he.

011:012 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
        heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

011:014 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to
        come.

011:015 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

011:016 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
        children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their
        fellows,

011:017 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we
        have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He
        hath a devil.

011:019 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold
        a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
        sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

011:020 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
        works were done, because they repented not:

011:021 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
        mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre
        and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
        ashes.

011:022 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
        Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

011:023 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
        brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been
        done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained
        until this day.

011:024 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the
        land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

011:025 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
        Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
        from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

011:026 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

011:027 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
        knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
        Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
        him.

011:028 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
        will give you rest.

011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
        lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

012:001 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;
        and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears
        of corn and to eat.

012:002 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
        disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath
        day.

012:003 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when
        he was an hungred, and they that were with him;

012:004 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the
        shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for
        them which were with him, but only for the priests?

012:005 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days
        the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are
        blameless?

012:006 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
        temple.

012:007 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and
        not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

012:008 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

012:009 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

012:010 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
        they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
        days? that they might accuse him.

012:011 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
        shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
        day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

012:012 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
        lawful to do well on the sabbath days.

012:013 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
        stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the
        other.

012:014 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,
        how they might destroy him.

012:015 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
        great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

012:016 And charged them that they should not make him known:

012:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying,

012:018 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my
        soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he
        shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

012:019 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
        voice in the streets.

012:020 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he
        not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

012:021 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

012:022 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,
        and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb
        both spake and saw.

012:023 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son
        of David?

012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth
        not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the
        devils.

012:025 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every
        kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
        every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

012:026 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself;
        how shall then his kingdom stand?

012:027 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your
        children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

012:028 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the
        kingdom of God is come unto you.

012:029 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil
        his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he
        will spoil his house.

012:030 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth
        not with me scattereth abroad.

012:031 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
        shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy
        Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

012:032 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
        be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy
        Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
        neither in the world to come.

012:033 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make
        the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known
        by his fruit.

012:034 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
        things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
        speaketh.

012:035 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth
        forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure
        bringeth forth evil things.

012:036 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
        they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

012:037 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
        thou shalt be condemned.

012:038 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
        saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.

012:039 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
        generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be
        given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:

012:040 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
        belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights
        in the heart of the earth.

012:041 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
        generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
        preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

012:042 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
        generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
        uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
        and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

012:043 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
        through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

012:044 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
        out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and
        garnished.

012:045 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
        more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:
        and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even
        so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

012:046 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
        brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

012:047 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
        stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

012:048 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
        mother? and who are my brethren?

012:049 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and
        said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

012:050 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in
        heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

013:001 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
        side.

013:002 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that
        he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on
        the shore.

013:003 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,
        Behold, a sower went forth to sow;

013:004 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the
        fowls came and devoured them up:

013:005 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
        and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of
        earth:

013:006 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they
        had no root, they withered away.

013:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and
        choked them:

013:008 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some
        an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

013:009 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

013:010 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
        unto them in parables?

013:011 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you
        to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
        is not given.

013:012 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
        more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be
        taken away even that he hath.

013:013 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
        not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

013:014 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,
        By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing
        ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

013:015 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are
        dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any
        time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
        and should understand with their heart, and should be
        converted, and I should heal them.

013:016 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for
        they hear.

013:017 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous
        men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
        not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
        have not heard them.

013:018 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

013:019 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
        understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth
        away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which
        received seed by the way side.

013:020 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is
        he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;

013:021 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for
        when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word,
        by and by he is offended.

013:022 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
        the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of
        riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

013:023 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
        heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth
        fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty,
        some thirty.

013:024 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
        heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his
        field:

013:025 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the
        wheat, and went his way.

013:026 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
        then appeared the tares also.

013:027 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him,
        Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence
        then hath it tares?

013:028 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said
        unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

013:029 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root
        up also the wheat with them.

013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
        harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first
        the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather
        the wheat into my barn.

013:031 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
        heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
        and sowed in his field:

013:032 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown,
        it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that
        the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

013:033 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
        like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
        measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

013:034 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;
        and without a parable spake he not unto them:

013:035 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
        saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things
        which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house:
        and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the
        parable of the tares of the field.

013:037 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed
        is the Son of man;

013:038 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

013:039 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end
        of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

013:040 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
        shall it be in the end of this world.

013:041 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
        gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them
        which do iniquity;

013:042 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
        wailing and gnashing of teeth.

013:043 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
        of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

013:044 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
        field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
        thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
        field.

013:045 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
        seeking goodly pearls:

013:046 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold
        all that he had, and bought it.

013:047 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
        into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

013:048 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and
        gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

013:049 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
        forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

013:050 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be
        wailing and gnashing of teeth.

013:051 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
        They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

013:052 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
        instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that
        is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure
        things new and old.

013:053 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
        parables, he departed thence.

013:054 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
        their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,
        Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called
        Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and
        Judas?

013:056 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath
        this man all these things?

013:057 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
        prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in
        his own house.

013:058 And he did not many mighty works there because of their
        unbelief.

014:001 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

014:002 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is
        risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth
        themselves in him.

014:003 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
        prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.

014:004 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

014:005 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the
        multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

014:006 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
        danced before them, and pleased Herod.

014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
        would ask.

014:008 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
        here John Baptist's head in a charger.

014:009 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
        them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given
        her.

014:010 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

014:011 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the
        damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

014:012 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it,
        and went and told Jesus.

014:013 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a
        desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof,
        they followed him on foot out of the cities.

014:014 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
        with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

014:015 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,
        This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the
        multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
        themselves victuals.

014:016 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them
        to eat.

014:017 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
        fishes.

014:018 He said, Bring them hither to me.

014:019 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
        took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to
        heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his
        disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

014:020 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
        fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

014:021 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
        women and children.

014:022 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
        ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent
        the multitudes away.

014:023 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
        mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was
        there alone.

014:024 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
        waves: for the wind was contrary.

014:025 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
        walking on the sea.

014:026 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
        troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

014:027 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good
        cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

014:028 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
        come unto thee on the water.

014:029 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the
        ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

014:030 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
        beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

014:031 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught
        him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
        didst thou doubt?

014:032 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

014:033 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him,
        saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

014:034 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
        Gennesaret.

014:035 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
        out into all that country round about, and brought unto him
        all that were diseased;

014:036 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his
        garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

015:001 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
        Jerusalem, saying,

015:002 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
        for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

015:003 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
        the commandment of God by your tradition?

015:004 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
        He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

015:005 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
        It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

015:006 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
        Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by
        your tradition.

015:007 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

015:008 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
        honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

015:009 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
        commandments of men.

015:010 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
        understand:

015:011 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
        which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

015:012 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
        the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

015:013 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly
        Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

015:014 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
        blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

015:015 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
        parable.

015:016 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

015:017 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
        mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

015:018 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
        from the heart; and they defile the man.

015:019 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,
        adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

015:020 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with
        unwashen hands defileth not a man.

015:021 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre
        and Sidon.

015:022 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
        and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son
        of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

015:023 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
        besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

015:024 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost
        sheep of the house of Israel.

015:025 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

015:026 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
        children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.

015:027 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
        which fall from their masters' table.

015:028 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
        faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was
        made whole from that very hour.

015:029 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
        Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

015:030 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those
        that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast
        them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:

015:031 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb
        to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the
        blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.

015:032 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
        compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
        three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them
        away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

015:033 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
        bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

015:034 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they
        said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

015:035 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

015:036 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
        and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples
        to the multitude.

015:037 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
        broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

015:038 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
        children.

015:039 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into
        the coasts of Magdala.

016:001 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting
        desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

016:002 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
        will be fair weather: for the sky is red.

016:003 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the
        sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the
        face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signstimes?

016:004 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
        there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the
        prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.

016:005 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
        forgotten to take bread.

016:006 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven
        of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

016:007 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
        have taken no bread.

016:008 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
        faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought
        no bread?

016:009 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of
        the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

016:010 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
        baskets ye took up?

016:011 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you
        concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the
        Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

016:012 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the
        leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of
        the Sadducees.

016:013 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
        his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man
        am?

016:014 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
        Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

016:015 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?

016:016 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
        Son of the living God.

016:017 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
        Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
        but my Father which is in heaven.

016:018 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
        rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
        prevail against it.

016:019 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
        and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
        heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
        loosed in heaven.

016:020 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man
        that he was Jesus the Christ.

016:021 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples,
        how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
        the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and
        be raised again the third day.

016:022 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it
        far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

016:023 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
        thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things
        that be of God, but those that be of men.

016:024 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
        me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
        me.

016:025 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
        will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

016:026 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
        and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange
        for his soul?

016:027 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
        his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to
        his works.

016:028 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which
        shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming
        in his kingdom.

017:001 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
        brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

017:002 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as
        the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.

017:003 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
        with him.

017:004 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for
        us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
        tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
        Elias.

017:005 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:
        and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my
        beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

017:006 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
        were sore afraid.

017:007 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
        afraid.

017:008 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
        Jesus only.

017:009 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
        saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be
        risen again from the dead.

017:010 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
        that Elias must first come?

017:011 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first
        come, and restore all things.

017:012 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
        him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.
        Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.

017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
        the Baptist.

017:014 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
        certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

017:015 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore
        vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the
        water.

017:016 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure
        him.

017:017 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
        generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I
        suffer you? bring him hither to me.

017:018 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and
        the child was cured from that very hour.

017:019 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could
        not we cast him out?

017:020 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily
        I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
        ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place;
        and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

017:021 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

017:022 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
        of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

017:023 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised
        again. And they were exceeding sorry.

017:024 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received
        tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master
        pay tribute?

017:025 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
        prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do
        the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own
        children, or of strangers?

017:026 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then
        are the children free.

017:027 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the
        sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
        up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a
        piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

018:001 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
        the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

018:002 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
        midst of them,

018:003 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
        become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
        of heaven.

018:004 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
        the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

018:005 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
        receiveth me.

018:006 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
        in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
        about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the
        sea.

018:007 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
        that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence
        cometh!

018:008 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
        and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
        life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet
        to be cast into everlasting fire.

018:009 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
        thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
        rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

018:010 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
        say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the
        face of my Father which is in heaven.

018:011 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

018:012 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them
        be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and
        goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone
        astray?

018:013 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he
        rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine
        which went not astray.

018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
        that one of these little ones should perish.

018:015 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
        tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall
        hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

018:016 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
        more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
        may be established.

018:017 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
        but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
        an heathen man and a publican.

018:018 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
        be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth
        shall be loosed in heaven.

018:019 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth
        as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done
        for them of my Father which is in heaven.

018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
        am I in the midst of them.

018:021 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
        brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?

018:022 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:
        but, Until seventy times seven.

018:023 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
        king, which would take account of his servants.

018:024 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him,
        which owed him ten thousand talents.

018:025 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to
        be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and
        payment to be made.

018:026 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
        Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

018:027 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
        loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

018:028 But the same servant went out, and found one of his
        fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid
        hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that
        thou owest.

018:029 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
        saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

018:030 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
        should pay the debt.

018:031 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
        sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

018:032 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
        thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
        thou desiredst me:

018:033 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
        fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?

018:034 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
        till he should pay all that was due unto him.

018:035 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
        from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
        trespasses.

019:001 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
        sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of
        Judaea beyond Jordan;

019:002 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

019:003 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
        unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for
        every cause?

019:004 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
        which made them at the beginning made them male and female,

019:005 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
        and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one
        flesh?

019:006 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What
        therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

019:007 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a
        writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

019:008 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your
        hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the
        beginning it was not so.

019:009 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
        it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
        adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit
        adultery.

019:010 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
        his wife, it is not good to marry.

019:011 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,
        save they to whom it is given.

019:012 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
        mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made
        eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made
        themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that
        is able to receive it, let him receive it.

019:013 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he
        should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples
        rebuked them.

019:014 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not,
        to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

019:015 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

019:016 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what
        good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

019:017 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
        good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
        keep the commandments.

019:018 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
        Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou
        shalt not bear false witness,

019:019 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy
        neighbour as thyself.

019:020 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept
        from my youth up: what lack I yet?

019:021 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that
        thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
        in heaven: and come and follow me.

019:022 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
        sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

019:023 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,
        That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

019:024 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go
        through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
        the kingdom of God.

019:025 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
        saying, Who then can be saved?

019:026 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
        impossible; but with God all things are possible.

019:027 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have
        forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

019:028 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
        have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man
        shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
        twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

019:029 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
        sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
        for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall
        inherit everlasting life.

019:030 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
        first.

020:001 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
        householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
        labourers into his vineyard.

020:002 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,
        he sent them into his vineyard.

020:003 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
        idle in the marketplace,

020:004 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and
        whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.

020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
        likewise.

020:006 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
        standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the
        day idle?

020:007 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto
        them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
        that shall ye receive.

020:008 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
        steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,
        beginning from the last unto the first.

020:009 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,
        they received every man a penny.

020:010 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
        received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

020:011 And when they had received it, they murmured against the
        goodman of the house,

020:012 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast
        made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat
        of the day.

020:013 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
        wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

020:014 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this
        last, even as unto thee.

020:015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
        thine eye evil, because I am good?

020:016 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be
        called, but few chosen.

020:017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples
        apart in the way, and said unto them,

020:018 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
        betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they
        shall condemn him to death,

020:019 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge,
        and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.

020:020 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her
        sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

020:021 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,
        Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right
        hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.

020:022 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
        able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be
        baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say
        unto him, We are able.

020:023 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and
        be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to
        sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but
        it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my
        Father.

020:024 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
        against the two brethren.

020:025 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
        princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
        that are great exercise authority upon them.

020:026 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
        among you, let him be your minister;

020:027 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
        servant:

020:028 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
        minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

020:029 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
        him.

020:030 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
        heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on
        us, O Lord, thou son of David.

020:031 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
        peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O
        Lord, thou son of David.

020:032 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
        that I shall do unto you?

020:033 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

020:034 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
        immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

021:001 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
        Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two
        disciples,

021:002 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
        straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her:
        loose them, and bring them unto me.

021:003 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
        need of them; and straightway he will send them.

021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
        by the prophet, saying,

021:005 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
        thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
        ass.

021:006 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

021:007 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their
        clothes, and they set him thereon.

021:008 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
        others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in
        the way.

021:009 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
        saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh
        in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

021:010 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
        saying, Who is this?

021:011 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth
        of Galilee.

021:012 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
        that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables
        of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

021:013 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
        the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

021:014 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
        healed them.

021:015 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
        things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
        saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore
        displeased,

021:016 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
        saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
        babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

021:017 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and
        he lodged there.

021:018 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

021:019 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
        found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let
        no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the
        fig tree withered away.

021:020 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How
        soon is the fig tree withered away!

021:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If
        ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which
        is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this
        mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it
        shall be done.

021:022 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
        ye shall receive.

021:023 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and
        the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and
        said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave
        thee this authority?

021:024 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one
        thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by
        what authority I do these things.

021:025 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?
        And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
        From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe
        him?

021:026 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold
        John as a prophet.

021:027 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
        unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
        things.

021:028 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
        the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

021:029 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
        and went.

021:030 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
        and said, I go, sir: and went not.

021:031 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say
        unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
        you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
        God before you.

021:032 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
        believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed
        him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that
        ye might believe him.

021:033 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
        planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a
        winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to
        husbandmen, and went into a far country:

021:034 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
        to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

021:035 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
        another, and stoned another.

021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they
        did unto them likewise.

021:037 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
        reverence my son.

021:038 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
        themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let
        us seize on his inheritance.

021:039 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and
        slew him.

021:040 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he
        do unto those husbandmen?

021:041 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men,
        and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
        shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

021:042 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
        The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
        head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is
        marvellous in our eyes?

021:043 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
        from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
        thereof.

021:044 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
        whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

021:045 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his
        parables, they perceived that he spake of them.

021:046 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
        multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

022:001 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
        said,

022:002 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made
        a marriage for his son,

022:003 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
        the wedding: and they would not come.

022:004 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which
        are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my
        fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the
        marriage.

022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his
        farm, another to his merchandise:

022:006 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them
        spitefully, and slew them.

022:007 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent
        forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up
        their city.

022:008 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
        which were bidden were not worthy.

022:009 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall
        find, bid to the marriage.

022:010 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
        together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
        wedding was furnished with guests.

022:011 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a
        man which had not on a wedding garment:

022:012 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not
        having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

022:013 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,
        and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there
        shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

022:014 For many are called, but few are chosen.

022:015 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
        entangle him in his talk.

022:016 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
        saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the
        way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
        regardest not the person of men.

022:017 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
        tribute unto Caesar, or not?

022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye
        me, ye hypocrites?

022:019 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

022:020 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
        superscription?

022:021 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
        therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto
        God the things that are God's.

022:022 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
        and went their way.

022:023 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there
        is no resurrection, and asked him,

022:024 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children,
        his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
        brother.

022:025 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
        had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his
        wife unto his brother:

022:026 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

022:027 And last of all the woman died also.

022:028 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
        seven? for they all had her.

022:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
        scriptures, nor the power of God.

022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
        marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

022:031 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
        that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

022:032 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
        Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

022:033 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
        doctrine.

022:034 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
        to silence, they were gathered together.

022:035 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
        tempting him, and saying,

022:036 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

022:037 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
        thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

022:038 This is the first and great commandment.

022:039 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
        as thyself.

022:040 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

022:041 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

022:042 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
        unto him, The son of David.

022:043 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him
        Lord, saying,

022:044 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I
        make thine enemies thy footstool?

022:045 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

022:046 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
        man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

023:001 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

023:002 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

023:003 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
        and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do
        not.

023:004 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
        them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move
        them with one of their fingers.

023:005 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
        broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
        garments,

023:006 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
        the synagogues,

023:007 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,
        Rabbi.

023:008 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even
        Christ; and all ye are brethren.

023:009 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
        Father, which is in heaven.

023:010 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
        Christ.

023:011 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

023:012 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
        shall humble himself shall be exalted.

023:013 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
        shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go
        in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go
        in.

023:014 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
        widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore
        ye shall receive the greater damnation.

023:015 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
        compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is
        made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than
        yourselves.

023:016 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall
        swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear
        by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!

023:017 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the
        temple that sanctifieth the gold?

023:018 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but
        whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.

023:019 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the
        altar that sanctifieth the gift?

023:020 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and
        by all things thereon.

023:021 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by
        him that dwelleth therein.

023:022 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
        God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

023:023 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
        tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the
        weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:
        these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
        undone.

023:024 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

023:025 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
        clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within
        they are full of extortion and excess.

023:026 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the
        cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

023:027 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are
        like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful
        outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all
        uncleanness.

023:028 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but
        within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

023:029 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
        build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of
        the righteous,

023:030 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would
        not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
        prophets.

023:031 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
        children of them which killed the prophets.

023:032 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.

023:033 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
        damnation of hell?

023:034 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
        scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some
        of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
        them from city to city:

023:035 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
        earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of
        Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple
        and the altar.

023:036 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
        generation.

023:037 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
        stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have
        gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
        chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

023:038 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

023:039 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
        shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

024:001 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
        disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the
        temple.

024:002 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily
        I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon
        another, that shall not be thrown down.

024:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
        unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things
        be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end
        of the world?

024:004 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man
        deceive you.

024:005 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
        deceive many.

024:006 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be
        not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the
        end is not yet.

024:007 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
        kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
        earthquakes, in divers places.

024:008 All these are the beginning of sorrows.

024:009 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
        you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

024:010 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
        and shall hate one another.

024:011 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

024:012 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
        cold.

024:013 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be
        saved.

024:014 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
        world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
        come.

024:015 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
        spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place,
        (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

024:016 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:

024:017 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any
        thing out of his house:

024:018 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his
        clothes.

024:019 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
        suck in those days!

024:020 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on
        the sabbath day:

024:021 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the
        beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

024:022 And except those days should be shortened, there should no
        flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
        shortened.

024:023 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
        there; believe it not.

024:024 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
        shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were
        possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

024:025 Behold, I have told you before.

024:026 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
        desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers;
        believe it not.

024:027 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
        unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

024:028 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
        gathered together.

024:029 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun
        be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the
        stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
        shall be shaken:

024:030 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
        and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they
        shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
        power and great glory.

024:031 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
        and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,
        from one end of heaven to the other.

024:032 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
        tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:

024:033 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that
        it is near, even at the doors.

024:034 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till
        all these things be fulfilled.

024:035 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
        away.

024:036 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
        heaven, but my Father only.

024:037 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the
        Son of man be.

024:038 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
        and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day
        that Noe entered into the ark,

024:039 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so
        shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

024:040 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
        the other left.

024:041 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be
        taken, and the other left.

024:042 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
        come.

024:043 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
        what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and
        would not have suffered his house to be broken up.

024:044 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think
        not the Son of man cometh.

024:045 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath
        made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due
        season?

024:046 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
        find so doing.

024:047 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all
        his goods.

024:048 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
        delayeth his coming;

024:049 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and
        drink with the drunken;

024:050 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh
        not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,

024:051 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with
        the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

025:001 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
        which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

025:002 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

025:003 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
        them:

025:004 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

025:005 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

025:006 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
        cometh; go ye out to meet him.

025:007 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

025:008 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
        our lamps are gone out.

025:009 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not
        enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and
        buy for yourselves.

025:010 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
        were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was
        shut.

025:011 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
        open to us.

025:012 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
        not.

025:013 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
        wherein the Son of man cometh.

025:014 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
        country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them
        his goods.

025:015 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
        another one; to every man according to his several ability;
        and straightway took his journey.

025:016 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded
        with the same, and made them other five talents.

025:017 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other
        two.

025:018 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
        hid his lord's money.

025:019 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
        reckoneth with them.

025:020 And so he that had received five talents came and brought
        other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me
        five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents
        more.

025:021 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
        servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
        make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of
        thy lord.

025:022 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,
        thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained
        two other talents beside them.

025:023 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
        thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
        ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

025:024 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
        I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast
        not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

025:025 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:
        lo, there thou hast that is thine.

025:026 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
        servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and
        gather where I have not strawed:

025:027 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
        exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine
        own with usury.

025:028 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
        hath ten talents.

025:029 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
        abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even
        that which he hath.

025:030 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:
        there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

025:031 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
        angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his
        glory:

025:032 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
        separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his
        sheep from the goats:

025:033 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on
        the left.

025:034 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
        blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
        from the foundation of the world:

025:035 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
        ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

025:036 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was
        in prison, and ye came unto me.

025:037 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
        thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
        drink?

025:038 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
        clothed thee?

025:039 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

025:040 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto
        you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
        these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

025:041 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
        me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
        and his angels:

025:042 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty,
        and ye gave me no drink:

025:043 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed
        me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

025:044 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
        thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
        or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

025:045 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
        Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did
        it not to me.

025:046 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
        righteous into life eternal.

026:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these
        sayings, he said unto his disciples,

026:002 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and
        the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

026:003 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes,
        and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high
        priest, who was called Caiaphas,

026:004 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill
        him.

026:005 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
        among the people.

026:006 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the
        leper,

026:007 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
        precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at
        meat.

026:008 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying,
        To what purpose is this waste?

026:009 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to
        the poor.

026:010 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
        the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

026:011 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
        always.

026:012 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
        it for my burial.

026:013 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
        preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this
        woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

026:014 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
        chief priests,

026:015 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver
        him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces
        of silver.

026:016 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

026:017 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
        disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that
        we prepare for thee to eat the passover?

026:018 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,
        The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover
        at thy house with my disciples.

026:019 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they
        made ready the passover.

026:020 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

026:021 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one
        of you shall betray me.

026:022 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
        to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

026:023 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in
        the dish, the same shall betray me.

026:024 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto
        that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good
        for that man if he had not been born.

026:025 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is
        it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

026:026 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
        brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;
        this is my body.

026:027 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
        saying, Drink ye all of it;

026:028 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
        many for the remission of sins.

026:029 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit
        of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my
        Father's kingdom.

026:030 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
        of Olives.

026:031 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because
        of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the
        shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered
        abroad.

026:032 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

026:033 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
        offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

026:034 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
        before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

026:035 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
        not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

026:036 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane,
        and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray
        yonder.

026:037 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
        began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

026:038 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
        unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

026:039 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and
        prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
        pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

026:040 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
        saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?

026:041 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
        indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

026:042 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
        Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink
        it, thy will be done.

026:043 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
        heavy.

026:044 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
        time, saying the same words.

026:045 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
        now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the
        Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

026:046 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
        me.

026:047 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came,
        and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from
        the chief priests and elders of the people.

026:048 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever
        I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

026:049 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
        kissed him.

026:050 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
        came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

026:051 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
        his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
        priest's, and smote off his ear.

026:052 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
        place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
        sword.

026:053 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
        shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

026:054 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
        must be?

026:055 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come
        out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?
        I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no
        hold on me.

026:056 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets
        might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and
        fled.

026:057 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
        the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
        assembled.

026:058 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace,
        and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

026:059 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
        false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

026:060 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet
        found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,

026:061 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of
        God, and to build it in three days.

026:062 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
        nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

026:063 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and
        said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
        us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.

026:064 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
        you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the
        right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

026:065 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
        blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now
        ye have heard his blasphemy.

026:066 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

026:067 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
        smote him with the palms of their hands,

026:068 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote
        thee?

026:069 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto
        him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

026:070 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
        sayest.

026:071 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
        and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with
        Jesus of Nazareth.

026:072 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

026:073 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said
        to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech
        bewrayeth thee.

026:074 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the
        man. And immediately the cock crew.

026:075 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
        Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went
        out, and wept bitterly.

027:001 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
        the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:

027:002 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered
        him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

027:003 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
        condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty
        pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

027:004 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent
        blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.

027:005 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
        departed, and went and hanged himself.

027:006 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is
        not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is
        the price of blood.

027:007 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's
        field, to bury strangers in.

027:008 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
        day.

027:009 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
        prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver,
        the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of
        Israel did value;

027:010 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed
        me.

027:011 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
        him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said
        unto him, Thou sayest.

027:012 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
        answered nothing.

027:013 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things
        they witness against thee?

027:014 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the
        governor marvelled greatly.

027:015 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
        people a prisoner, whom they would.

027:016 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

027:017 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
        them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus
        which is called Christ?

027:018 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

027:019 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
        him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I
        have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

027:020 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
        they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

027:021 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
        will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

027:022 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which
        is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

027:023 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
        cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

027:024 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather
        a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before
        the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just
        person: see ye to it.

027:025 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us,
        and on our children.

027:026 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
        Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.

027:027 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
        hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

027:028 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

027:029 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
        his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the
        knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the
        Jews!

027:030 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on
        the head.

027:031 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off
        from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
        crucify him.

027:032 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
        name: him they compelled to bear his cross.

027:033 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is
        to say, a place of a skull,

027:034 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he
        had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

027:035 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
        that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
        They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
        they cast lots.

027:036 And sitting down they watched him there;

027:037 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS
        THE KING OF THE JEWS.

027:038 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the
        right hand, and another on the left.

027:039 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

027:040 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it
        in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come
        down from the cross.

027:041 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
        and elders, said,

027:042 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
        Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
        believe him.

027:043 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
        him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

027:044 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
        in his teeth.

027:045 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
        unto the ninth hour.

027:046 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
        saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my
        God, why hast thou forsaken me?

027:047 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said,
        This man calleth for Elias.

027:048 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
        it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

027:049 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
        save him.

027:050 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up
        the ghost.

027:051 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
        top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks
        rent;

027:052 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints
        which slept arose,

027:053 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went
        into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

027:054 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
        Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done,
        they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

027:055 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
        Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

027:056 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James
        and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.

027:057 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
        named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:

027:058 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
        commanded the body to be delivered.

027:059 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
        linen cloth,

027:060 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the
        rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
        sepulchre, and departed.

027:061 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
        against the sepulchre.

027:062 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,
        the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,

027:063 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was
        yet alive, After three days I will rise again.

027:064 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
        third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him
        away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so
        the last error shall be worse than the first.

027:065 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it
        as sure as ye can.

027:066 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
        and setting a watch.

028:001 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
        first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
        to see the sepulchre.

028:002 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
        the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the
        stone from the door, and sat upon it.

028:003 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
        snow:

028:004 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
        men.

028:005 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:
        for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

028:006 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the
        place where the Lord lay.

028:007 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from
        the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there
        shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

028:008 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and
        great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

028:009 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met
        them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the
        feet, and worshipped him.

028:010 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren
        that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

028:011 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into
        the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things
        that were done.

028:012 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
        counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,

028:013 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him
        away while we slept.

028:014 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,
        and secure you.

028:015 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this
        saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

028:016 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
        mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

028:017 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

028:018 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
        unto me in heaven and in earth.

028:019 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
        name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

028:020 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
        commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
        of the world. Amen.

Book 41	Mark

001:001 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

001:002 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger
        before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

001:003 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
        of the Lord, make his paths straight.

001:004 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
        repentance for the remission of sins.

001:005 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they
        of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of
        Jordan, confessing their sins.

001:006 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a
        skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

001:007 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after
        me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down
        and unloose.

001:008 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize
        you with the Holy Ghost.

001:009 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from
        Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

001:010 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
        opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

001:011 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my
        beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

001:012 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

001:013 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of
        Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
        unto him.

001:014 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
        Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

001:015 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is
        at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

001:016 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
        Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were
        fishers.

001:017 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make
        you to become fishers of men.

001:018 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

001:019 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the
        ship mending their nets.

001:020 And straightway he called them: and they left their father
        Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after
        him.

001:021 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath
        day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

001:022 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them
        as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

001:023 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
        and he cried out,

001:024 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
        of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
        art, the Holy One of God.

001:025 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
        him.

001:026 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a
        loud voice, he came out of him.

001:027 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
        themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is
        this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean
        spirits, and they do obey him.

001:028 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the
        region round about Galilee.

001:029 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
        entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and
        John.

001:030 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they
        tell him of her.

001:031 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
        immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

001:032 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all
        that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

001:033 And all the city was gathered together at the door.

001:034 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
        out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because
        they knew him.

001:035 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he
        went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
        prayed.

001:036 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.

001:037 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek
        for thee.

001:038 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I
        may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

001:039 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee,
        and cast out devils.

001:040 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling
        down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst
        make me clean.

001:041 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and
        touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

001:042 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
        from him, and he was cleansed.

001:043 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

001:044 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go
        thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy
        cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony
        unto them.

001:045 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
        abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly
        enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and
        they came to him from every quarter.

002:001 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it
        was noised that he was in the house.

002:002 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that
        there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about
        the door: and he preached the word unto them.

002:003 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which
        was borne of four.

002:004 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
        uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it
        up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

002:005 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the
        palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

002:006 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and
        reasoning in their hearts,

002:007 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
        but God only?

002:008 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they
        so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason
        ye these things in your hearts?

002:009 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins
        be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and
        walk?

002:010 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
        to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

002:011 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way
        into thine house.

002:012 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth
        before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and
        glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

002:013 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
        resorted unto him, and he taught them.

002:014 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting
        at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he
        arose and followed him.

002:015 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
        many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and
        his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.

002:016 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
        and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he
        eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?

002:017 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole
        have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came
        not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

002:018 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast:
        and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John
        and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?

002:019 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
        fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have
        the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

002:020 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
        away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

002:021 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment:
        else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old,
        and the rent is made worse.

002:022 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new
        wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the
        bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new
        bottles.

002:023 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on
        the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to
        pluck the ears of corn.

002:024 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
        sabbath day that which is not lawful?

002:025 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when
        he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with
        him?

002:026 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the
        high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to
        eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with
        him?

002:027 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
        man for the sabbath:

002:028 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

003:001 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man
        there which had a withered hand.

003:002 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath
        day; that they might accuse him.

003:003 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
        forth.

003:004 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
        days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held
        their peace.

003:005 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
        grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the
        man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and
        his hand was restored whole as the other.

003:006 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel
        with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

003:007 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and
        a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,

003:008 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan;
        and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they
        had heard what great things he did, came unto him.

003:009 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait
        on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

003:010 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him
        for to touch him, as many as had plagues.

003:011 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him,
        and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

003:012 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him
        known.

003:013 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
        would: and they came unto him.

003:014 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that
        he might send them forth to preach,

003:015 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:

003:016 And Simon he surnamed Peter;

003:017 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James;
        and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:

003:018 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and
        Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and
        Simon the Canaanite,

003:019 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went
        into an house.

003:020 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could
        not so much as eat bread.

003:021 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on
        him: for they said, He is beside himself.

003:022 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
        Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out
        devils.

003:023 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables,
        How can Satan cast out Satan?

003:024 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom
        cannot stand.

003:025 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
        stand.

003:026 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he
        cannot stand, but hath an end.

003:027 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his
        goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he
        will spoil his house.

003:028 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the
        sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall
        blaspheme:

003:029 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
        forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.

003:030 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

003:031 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
        without, sent unto him, calling him.

003:032 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him,
        Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.

003:033 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my
        brethren?

003:034 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and
        said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

003:035 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my
        brother, and my sister, and mother.

004:001 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
        gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a
        ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the
        sea on the land.

004:002 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them
        in his doctrine,

004:003 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

004:004 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side,
        and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

004:005 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth;
        and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of
        earth:

004:006 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had
        no root, it withered away.

004:007 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked
        it, and it yielded no fruit.

004:008 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang
        up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some
        sixty, and some an hundred.

004:009 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him
        hear.

004:010 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the
        twelve asked of him the parable.

004:011 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the
        mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without,
        all these things are done in parables:

004:012 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they
        may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be
        converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.

004:013 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
        will ye know all parables?

004:014 The sower soweth the word.

004:015 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown;
        but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh
        away the word that was sown in their hearts.

004:016 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground;
        who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it
        with gladness;

004:017 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
        afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the
        word's sake, immediately they are offended.

004:018 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear
        the word,

004:019 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
        and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and
        it becometh unfruitful.

004:020 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
        the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some
        thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

004:021 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
        bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

004:022 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested;
        neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come
        abroad.

004:023 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

004:024 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what
        measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you
        that hear shall more be given.

004:025 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,
        from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

004:026 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
        seed into the ground;

004:027 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
        spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

004:028 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the
        blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

004:029 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
        the sickle, because the harvest is come.

004:030 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or
        with what comparison shall we compare it?

004:031 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in
        the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

004:032 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than
        all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls
        of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.

004:033 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as
        they were able to hear it.

004:034 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they
        were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

004:035 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them,
        Let us pass over unto the other side.

004:036 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even
        as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other
        little ships.

004:037 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into
        the ship, so that it was now full.

004:038 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
        and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not
        that we perish?

004:039 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,
        Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great
        calm.

004:040 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that
        ye have no faith?

004:041 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What
        manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
        him?

005:001 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the
        country of the Gadarenes.

005:002 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met
        him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,

005:003 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind
        him, no, not with chains:

005:004 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains,
        and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the
        fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.

005:005 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
        tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.

005:006 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,

005:007 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with
        thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by
        God, that thou torment me not.

005:008 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean
        spirit.

005:009 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying,
        My name is Legion: for we are many.

005:010 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out
        of the country.

005:011 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of
        swine feeding.

005:012 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the
        swine, that we may enter into them.

005:013 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits
        went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran
        violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about
        two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.

005:014 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and
        in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was
        done.

005:015 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with
        the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in
        his right mind: and they were afraid.

005:016 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
        possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

005:017 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.

005:018 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
        with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.

005:019 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to
        thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done
        for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.

005:020 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great
        things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.

005:021 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other
        side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the
        sea.

005:022 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
        Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

005:023 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at
        the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on
        her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.

005:024 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
        thronged him.

005:025 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,

005:026 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
        all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew
        worse,

005:027 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
        touched his garment.

005:028 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be
        whole.

005:029 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and
        she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

005:030 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
        out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who
        touched my clothes?

005:031 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude
        thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

005:032 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

005:033 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
        her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the
        truth.

005:034 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee
        whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

005:035 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the
        synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead:
        why troublest thou the Master any further?

005:036 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto
        the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.

005:037 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James,
        and John the brother of James.

005:038 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
        seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

005:039 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
        ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

005:040 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all
        out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and
        them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was
        lying.

005:041 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
        cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee,
        arise.

005:042 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of
        the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great
        astonishment.

005:043 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
        commanded that something should be given her to eat.

006:001 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country;
        and his disciples follow him.

006:002 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
        synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From
        whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this
        which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are
        wrought by his hands?

006:003 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of
        James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his
        sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.

006:004 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour,
        but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own
        house.

006:005 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his
        hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

006:006 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
        about the villages, teaching.

006:007 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them
        forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean
        spirits;

006:008 And commanded them that they should take nothing for their
        journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in
        their purse:

006:009 But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

006:010 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
        house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

006:011 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye
        depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a
        testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be
        more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment,
        than for that city.

006:012 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

006:013 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that
        were sick, and healed them.

006:014 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)
        and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead,
        and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

006:015 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a
        prophet, or as one of the prophets.

006:016 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I
        beheaded: he is risen from the dead.

006:017 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and
        bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's
        wife: for he had married her.

006:018 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to
        have thy brother's wife.

006:019 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
        killed him; but she could not:

006:020 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an
        holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many
        things, and heard him gladly.

006:021 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
        made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates
        of Galilee;

006:022 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and
        danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king
        said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I
        will give it thee.

006:023 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
        give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.

006:024 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I
        ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

006:025 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and
        asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger
        the head of John the Baptist.

006:026 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and
        for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.

006:027 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded
        his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the
        prison,

006:028 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel:
        and the damsel gave it to her mother.

006:029 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
        corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

006:030 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
        told him all things, both what they had done, and what they
        had taught.

006:031 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
        place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going,
        and they had no leisure so much as to eat.

006:032 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.

006:033 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
        afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came
        together unto him.

006:034 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved
        with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not
        having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.

006:035 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto
        him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far
        passed:

006:036 Send them away, that they may go into the country round about,
        and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have
        nothing to eat.

006:037 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they
        say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of
        bread, and give them to eat?

006:038 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And
        when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

006:039 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon
        the green grass.

006:040 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.

006:041 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
        looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and
        gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two
        fishes divided he among them all.

006:042 And they did all eat, and were filled.

006:043 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of
        the fishes.

006:044 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand
        men.

006:045 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
        ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while
        he sent away the people.

006:046 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
        pray.

006:047 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea,
        and he alone on the land.

006:048 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary
        unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh
        unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by
        them.

006:049 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it
        had been a spirit, and cried out:

006:050 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he
        talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is
        I; be not afraid.

006:051 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased:
        and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and
        wondered.

006:052 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their
        heart was hardened.

006:053 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
        Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

006:054 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
        him,

006:055 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to
        carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he
        was.

006:056 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
        country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him
        that they might touch if it were but the border of his
        garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.

007:001 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
        scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

007:002 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with
        defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found
        fault.

007:003 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their
        hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

007:004 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
        not. And many other things there be, which they have received
        to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and
        of tables.

007:005 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
        disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat
        bread with unwashen hands?

007:006 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of
        you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me
        with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

007:007 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
        commandments of men.

007:008 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition
        of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such
        like things ye do.

007:009 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of
        God, that ye may keep your own tradition.

007:010 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
        curseth father or mother, let him die the death:

007:011 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is
        Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be
        profited by me; he shall be free.

007:012 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
        mother;

007:013 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition,
        which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.

007:014 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
        them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:

007:015 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him
        can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those
        are they that defile the man.

007:016 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

007:017 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
        disciples asked him concerning the parable.

007:018 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?
        Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without
        entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;

007:019 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly,
        and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?

007:020 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth
        the man.

007:021 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil
        thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

007:022 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an
        evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

007:023 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

007:024 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre
        and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man
        know it: but he could not be hid.

007:025 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean
        spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

007:026 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she
        besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her
        daughter.

007:027 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for
        it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it
        unto the dogs.

007:028 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
        under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

007:029 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is
        gone out of thy daughter.

007:030 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone
        out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

007:031 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he
        came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts
        of Decapolis.

007:032 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an
        impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand
        upon him.

007:033 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
        into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

007:034 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,
        Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

007:035 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
        tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.

007:036 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more
        he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published
        it;

007:037 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
        things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to
        speak.

008:001 In those days the multitude being very great, and having
        nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith
        unto them,

008:002 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been
        with me three days, and have nothing to eat:

008:003 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will
        faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.

008:004 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
        these men with bread here in the wilderness?

008:005 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
        Seven.

008:006 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he
        took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to
        his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before
        the people.

008:007 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded
        to set them also before them.

008:008 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
        broken meat that was left seven baskets.

008:009 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent
        them away.

008:010 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
        came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

008:011 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,
        seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

008:012 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
        generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There
        shall no sign be given unto this generation.

008:013 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
        the other side.

008:014 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had
        they in the ship with them more than one loaf.

008:015 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven
        of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

008:016 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
        have no bread.

008:017 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,
        because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither
        understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?

008:018 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do
        ye not remember?

008:019 When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many
        baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him,
        Twelve.

008:020 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full
        of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

008:021 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?

008:022 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto
        him, and besought him to touch him.

008:023 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
        town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon
        him, he asked him if he saw ought.

008:024 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

008:025 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
        look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

008:026 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
        town, nor tell it to any in the town.

008:027 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of
        Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples,
        saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?

008:028 And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
        others, One of the prophets.

008:029 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
        answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

008:030 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

008:031 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer
        many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief
        priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
        again.

008:032 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began
        to rebuke him.

008:033 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
        rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou
        savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that
        be of men.

008:034 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
        also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him
        deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

008:035 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever
        shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same
        shall save it.

008:036 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
        world, and lose his own soul?

008:037 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

008:038 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in
        this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the
        Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his
        Father with the holy angels.

009:001 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be
        some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death,
        till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

009:002 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
        John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by
        themselves: and he was transfigured before them.

009:003 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as
        no fuller on earth can white them.

009:004 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were
        talking with Jesus.

009:005 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for
        us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for
        thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

009:006 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

009:007 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came
        out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

009:008 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no
        man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.

009:009 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that
        they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the
        Son of man were risen from the dead.

009:010 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one
        with another what the rising from the dead should mean.

009:011 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias
        must first come?

009:012 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and
        restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man,
        that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.

009:013 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have
        done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

009:014 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude
        about them, and the scribes questioning with them.

009:015 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were
        greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.

009:016 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?

009:017 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have
        brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;

009:018 And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth,
        and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to
        thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could
        not.

009:019 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long
        shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him
        unto me.

009:020 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him,
        straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground,
        and wallowed foaming.

009:021 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came
        unto him? And he said, Of a child.

009:022 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the
        waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have
        compassion on us, and help us.

009:023 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
        possible to him that believeth.

009:024 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said
        with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

009:025 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he
        rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf
        spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into
        him.

009:026 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him:
        and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

009:027 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he
        arose.

009:028 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
        privately, Why could not we cast him out?

009:029 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,
        but by prayer and fasting.

009:030 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
        would not that any man should know it.

009:031 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of
        man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill
        him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.

009:032 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask
        him.

009:033 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked
        them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the
        way?

009:034 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed
        among themselves, who should be the greatest.

009:035 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them,
        If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all,
        and servant of all.

009:036 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and
        when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,

009:037 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name,
        receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not
        me, but him that sent me.

009:038 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
        devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad
        him, because he followeth not us.

009:039 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which
        shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of
        me.

009:040 For he that is not against us is on our part.

009:041 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my
        name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he
        shall not lose his reward.

009:042 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that
        believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were
        hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

009:043 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
        to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into
        hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

009:044 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

009:045 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
        to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into
        hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

009:046 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

009:047 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for
        thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than
        having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:

009:048 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

009:049 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
        shall be salted with salt.

009:050 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness,
        wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have
        peace one with another.

010:001 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea
        by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him
        again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.

010:002 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for
        a man to put away his wife? tempting him.

010:003 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command
        you?

010:004 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement,
        and to put her away.

010:005 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of
        your heart he wrote you this precept.

010:006 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
        female.

010:007 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
        cleave to his wife;

010:008 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more
        twain, but one flesh.

010:009 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
        asunder.

010:010 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
        matter.

010:011 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
        marry another, committeth adultery against her.

010:012 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
        another, she committeth adultery.

010:013 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
        them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.

010:014 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
        them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
        them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

010:015 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
        of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.

010:016 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
        blessed them.

010:017 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one
        running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what
        shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

010:018 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is
        none good but one, that is, God.

010:019 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
        kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not,
        Honour thy father and mother.

010:020 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I
        observed from my youth.

010:021 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One
        thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and
        give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and
        come, take up the cross, and follow me.

010:022 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he
        had great possessions.

010:023 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples,
        How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom
        of God!

010:024 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
        answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it
        for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of
        God!

010:025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
        than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

010:026 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
        themselves, Who then can be saved?

010:027 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible,
        but not with God: for with God all things are possible.

010:028 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and
        have followed thee.

010:029 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is
        no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or
        father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
        sake, and the gospel's,

010:030 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
        and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
        lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal
        life.

010:031 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.

010:032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
        before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they
        were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell
        them what things should happen unto him,

010:033 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man
        shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the
        scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall
        deliver him to the Gentiles:

010:034 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit
        upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise
        again.

010:035 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him,
        saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us
        whatsoever we shall desire.

010:036 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?

010:037 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
        right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

010:038 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye
        drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the
        baptism that I am baptized with?

010:039 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye
        shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the
        baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

010:040 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to
        give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.

010:041 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased
        with James and John.

010:042 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know
        that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles
        exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise
        authority upon them.

010:043 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
        among you, shall be your minister:

010:044 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of
        all.

010:045 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
        minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

010:046 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with
        his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus,
        the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

010:047 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to
        cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

010:048 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he
        cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on
        me.

010:049 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And
        they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,
        rise; he calleth thee.

010:050 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.

010:051 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
        should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I
        might receive my sight.

010:052 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
        whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed
        Jesus in the way.

011:001 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and
        Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his
        disciples,

011:002 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against
        you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a
        colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.

011:003 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the
        Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him
        hither.

011:004 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
        without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

011:005 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do
        ye, loosing the colt?

011:006 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they
        let them go.

011:007 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on
        him; and he sat upon him.

011:008 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
        branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

011:009 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried,
        saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
        Lord:

011:010 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the
        name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

011:011 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and
        when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the
        eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

011:012 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
        hungry:

011:013 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if
        haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it,
        he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

011:014 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
        hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.

011:015 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple,
        and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple,
        and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats
        of them that sold doves;

011:016 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel
        through the temple.

011:017 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
        shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye
        have made it a den of thieves.

011:018 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how
        they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the
        people was astonished at his doctrine.

011:019 And when even was come, he went out of the city.

011:020 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
        dried up from the roots.

011:021 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master,
        behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.

011:022 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

011:023 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
        mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and
        shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those
        things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have
        whatsoever he saith.

011:024 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when
        ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

011:025 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
        any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you
        your trespasses.

011:026 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
        heaven forgive your trespasses.

011:027 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the
        temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes,
        and the elders,

011:028 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things?
        and who gave thee this authority to do these things?

011:029 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you
        one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what
        authority I do these things.

011:030 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.

011:031 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
        From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

011:032 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all
        men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.

011:033 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And
        Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what
        authority I do these things.

012:001 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
        planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a
        place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to
        husbandmen, and went into a far country.

012:002 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
        might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the
        vineyard.

012:003 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

012:004 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they
        cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away
        shamefully handled.

012:005 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many
        others; beating some, and killing some.

012:006 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him
        also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

012:007 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
        come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.

012:008 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
        vineyard.

012:009 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
        and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto
        others.

012:010 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
        builders rejected is become the head of the corner:

012:011 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

012:012 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for
        they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and
        they left him, and went their way.

012:013 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
        Herodians, to catch him in his words.

012:014 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know
        that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest
        not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth:
        Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

012:015 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
        hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny,
        that I may see it.

012:016 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this
        image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

012:017 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the
        things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
        God's. And they marvelled at him.

012:018 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
        resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

012:019 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave
        his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother
        should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

012:020 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
        dying left no seed.

012:021 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:
        and the third likewise.

012:022 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
        died also.

012:023 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose
        wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

012:024 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
        because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?

012:025 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry,
        nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in
        heaven.

012:026 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
        the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying,
        I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
        Jacob?

012:027 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye
        therefore do greatly err.

012:028 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
        together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked
        him, Which is the first commandment of all?

012:029 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is,
        Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

012:030 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
        with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
        strength: this is the first commandment.

012:031 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
        neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater
        than these.

012:032 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
        truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

012:033 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the
        understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the
        strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than
        all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

012:034 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
        him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man
        after that durst ask him any question.

012:035 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple,
        How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?

012:036 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my
        Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
        footstool.

012:037 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he
        then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

012:038 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
        which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the
        marketplaces,

012:039 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms
        at feasts:

012:040 Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long
        prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.

012:041 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
        people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich
        cast in much.

012:042 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two
        mites, which make a farthing.

012:043 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
        Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in,
        than all they which have cast into the treasury:

012:044 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her
        want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

013:001 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith
        unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings
        are here!

013:002 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
        buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another,
        that shall not be thrown down.

013:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the
        temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him
        privately,

013:004 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the
        sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?

013:005 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man
        deceive you:

013:006 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
        deceive many.

013:007 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
        troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not
        be yet.

013:008 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
        kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and
        there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings
        of sorrows.

013:009 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
        councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye
        shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a
        testimony against them.

013:010 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

013:011 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
        thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye
        premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour,
        that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy
        Ghost.

013:012 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
        father the son; and children shall rise up against their
        parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.

013:013 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
        that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

013:014 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
        by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him
        that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee
        to the mountains:

013:015 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the
        house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his
        house:

013:016 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to
        take up his garment.

013:017 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give
        suck in those days!

013:018 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.

013:019 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from
        the beginning of the creation which God created unto this
        time, neither shall be.

013:020 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
        should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath
        chosen, he hath shortened the days.

013:021 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
        lo, he is there; believe him not:

013:022 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall
        shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even
        the elect.

013:023 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.

013:024 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
        darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

013:025 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in
        heaven shall be shaken.

013:026 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds
        with great power and glory.

013:027 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together
        his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the
        earth to the uttermost part of heaven.

013:028 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
        tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:

013:029 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to
        pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

013:030 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass,
        till all these things be done.

013:031 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
        away.

013:032 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the
        angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

013:033 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time
        is.

013:034 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
        his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every
        man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

013:035 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the
        house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing,
        or in the morning:

013:036 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

013:037 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

014:001 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of
        unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought
        how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.

014:002 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
        of the people.

014:003 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he
        sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of
        ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box,
        and poured it on his head.

014:004 And there were some that had indignation within themselves,
        and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?

014:005 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,
        and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against
        her.

014:006 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
        wrought a good work on me.

014:007 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will
        ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.

014:008 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint
        my body to the burying.

014:009 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
        preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath
        done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

014:010 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
        priests, to betray him unto them.

014:011 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give
        him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

014:012 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
        passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we
        go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?

014:013 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto
        them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man
        bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

014:014 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
        house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I
        shall eat the passover with my disciples?

014:015 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and
        prepared: there make ready for us.

014:016 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and
        found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the
        passover.

014:017 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

014:018 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto
        you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

014:019 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by
        one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?

014:020 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve,
        that dippeth with me in the dish.

014:021 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe
        to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it
        for that man if he had never been born.

014:022 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
        it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

014:023 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it
        to them: and they all drank of it.

014:024 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
        which is shed for many.

014:025 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of
        the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of
        God.

014:026 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
        of Olives.

014:027 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
        me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
        and the sheep shall be scattered.

014:028 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

014:029 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
        will not I.

014:030 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this
        day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou
        shalt deny me thrice.

014:031 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I
        will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

014:032 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
        saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

014:033 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to
        be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;

014:034 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto
        death: tarry ye here, and watch.

014:035 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and
        prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from
        him.

014:036 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
        take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but
        what thou wilt.

014:037 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto
        Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?

014:038 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit
        truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.

014:039 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

014:040 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
        eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.

014:041 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on
        now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come;
        behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

014:042 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

014:043 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
        twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,
        from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

014:044 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
        Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead
        him away safely.

014:045 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
        saith, Master, master; and kissed him.

014:046 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

014:047 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a
        servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

014:048 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
        against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?

014:049 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me
        not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

014:050 And they all forsook him, and fled.

014:051 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen
        cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold
        on him:

014:052 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

014:053 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
        assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the
        scribes.

014:054 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
        high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself
        at the fire.

014:055 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
        against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

014:056 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
        agreed not together.

014:057 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
        saying,

014:058 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with
        hands, and within three days I will build another made without
        hands.

014:059 But neither so did their witness agree together.

014:060 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
        saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness
        against thee?

014:061 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high
        priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the
        Son of the Blessed?

014:062 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting
        on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
        heaven.

014:063 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
        any further witnesses?

014:064 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all
        condemned him to be guilty of death.

014:065 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
        buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants
        did strike him with the palms of their hands.

014:066 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of
        the maids of the high priest:

014:067 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him,
        and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.

014:068 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
        thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock
        crew.

014:069 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
        by, This is one of them.

014:070 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by
        said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art
        a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.

014:071 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this
        man of whom ye speak.

014:072 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind
        the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice,
        thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he
        wept.

015:001 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
        consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole
        council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered
        him to Pilate.

015:002 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
        answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.

015:003 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he
        answered nothing.

015:004 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
        behold how many things they witness against thee.

015:005 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

015:006 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,
        whomsoever they desired.

015:007 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them
        that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder
        in the insurrection.

015:008 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
        had ever done unto them.

015:009 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto
        you the King of the Jews?

015:010 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

015:011 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
        release Barabbas unto them.

015:012 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye
        then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the
        Jews?

015:013 And they cried out again, Crucify him.

015:014 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
        they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

015:015 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released
        Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged
        him, to be crucified.

015:016 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called
        Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.

015:017 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of
        thorns, and put it about his head,

015:018 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

015:019 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon
        him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.

015:020 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from
        him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to
        crucify him.

015:021 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming
        out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear
        his cross.

015:022 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
        interpreted, The place of a skull.

015:023 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
        received it not.

015:024 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
        casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

015:025 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

015:026 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
        KING OF THE JEWS.

015:027 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
        hand, and the other on his left.

015:028 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
        numbered with the transgressors.

015:029 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
        and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
        it in three days,

015:030 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

015:031 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
        with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

015:032 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
        we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him
        reviled him.

015:033 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
        whole land until the ninth hour.

015:034 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
        Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My
        God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

015:035 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said,
        Behold, he calleth Elias.

015:036 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on
        a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see
        whether Elias will come to take him down.

015:037 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

015:038 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
        the bottom.

015:039 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
        he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this
        man was the Son of God.

015:040 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
        Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses,
        and Salome;

015:041 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
        ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with
        him unto Jerusalem.

015:042 And now when the even was come, because it was the
        preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also
        waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto
        Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

015:044 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
        him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while
        dead.

015:045 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
        Joseph.

015:046 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him
        in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out
        of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

015:047 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where
        he was laid.

016:001 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
        mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that
        they might come and anoint him.

016:002 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they
        came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

016:003 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the
        stone from the door of the sepulchre?

016:004 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away:
        for it was very great.

016:005 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting
        on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they
        were affrighted.

016:006 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
        Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here:
        behold the place where they laid him.

016:007 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
        before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said
        unto you.

016:008 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for
        they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to
        any man; for they were afraid.

016:009 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he
        appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast
        seven devils.

016:010 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they
        mourned and wept.

016:011 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been
        seen of her, believed not.

016:012 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as
        they walked, and went into the country.

016:013 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed
        they them.

016:014 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
        upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,
        because they believed not them which had seen him after he was
        risen.

016:015 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach
        the gospel to every creature.

016:016 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
        believeth not shall be damned.

016:017 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name
        shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

016:018 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly
        thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the
        sick, and they shall recover.

016:019 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received
        up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

016:020 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord
        working with them, and confirming the word with signs
        following. Amen.

Book 42	Luke

001:001 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
        declaration of those things which are most surely believed
        among us,

001:002 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning
        were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

001:003 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
        all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,
        most excellent Theophilus,

001:004 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein
        thou hast been instructed.

001:005 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
        priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife
        was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

001:006 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
        commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

001:007 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
        they both were now well stricken in years.

001:008 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's
        office before God in the order of his course,

001:009 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to
        burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

001:010 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at
        the time of incense.

001:011 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on
        the right side of the altar of incense.

001:012 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
        upon him.

001:013 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
        prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
        and thou shalt call his name John.

001:014 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
        at his birth.

001:015 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
        drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled
        with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.

001:016 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
        their God.

001:017 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
        to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
        disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
        prepared for the Lord.

001:018 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
        for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.

001:019 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
        stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
        and to shew thee these glad tidings.

001:020 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until
        the day that these things shall be performed, because thou
        believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their
        season.

001:021 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
        tarried so long in the temple.

001:022 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
        perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
        beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.

001:023 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
        ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

001:024 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
        herself five months, saying,

001:025 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked
        on me, to take away my reproach among men.

001:026 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
        unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

001:027 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
        house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

001:028 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
        highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among
        women.

001:029 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast
        in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.

001:030 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
        found favour with God.

001:031 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
        a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

001:032 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
        and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
        David:

001:033 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
        his kingdom there shall be no end.

001:034 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
        know not a man?

001:035 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
        come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
        thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
        thee shall be called the Son of God.

001:036 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
        son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who
        was called barren.

001:037 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

001:038 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
        according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

001:039 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country
        with haste, into a city of Juda;

001:040 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted
        Elisabeth.

001:041 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation
        of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled
        with the Holy Ghost:

001:042 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
        thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

001:043 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should
        come to me?

001:044 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in
        mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

001:045 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a
        performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

001:046 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

001:047 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

001:048 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
        behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

001:049 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy
        is his name.

001:050 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
        generation.

001:051 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
        proud in the imagination of their hearts.

001:052 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them
        of low degree.

001:053 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he
        hath sent empty away.

001:054 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his
        mercy;

001:055 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for
        ever.

001:056 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to
        her own house.

001:057 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;
        and she brought forth a son.

001:058 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had
        shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

001:059 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
        circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
        name of his father.

001:060 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be
        called John.

001:061 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
        called by this name.

001:062 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him
        called.

001:063 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name
        is John. And they marvelled all.

001:064 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,
        and he spake, and praised God.

001:065 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all
        these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill
        country of Judaea.

001:066 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
        saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of
        the Lord was with him.

001:067 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
        prophesied, saying,

001:068 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
        redeemed his people,

001:069 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of
        his servant David;

001:070 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been
        since the world began:

001:071 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of
        all that hate us;

001:072 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember
        his holy covenant;

001:073 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

001:074 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of
        the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our
        life.

001:076 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
        for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his
        ways;

001:077 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the
        remission of their sins,

001:078 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
        from on high hath visited us,

001:079 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow
        of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

001:080 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
        deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

002:001 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a
        decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be
        taxed.

002:002 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
        Syria.)

002:003 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

002:004 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of
        Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called
        Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

002:005 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with
        child.

002:006 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
        accomplished that she should be delivered.

002:007 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
        swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
        no room for them in the inn.

002:008 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
        field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

002:009 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
        of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

002:010 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
        you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

002:011 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
        which is Christ the Lord.

002:012 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
        wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

002:013 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
        heavenly host praising God, and saying,

002:014 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
        toward men.

002:015 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
        into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
        even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
        which the Lord hath made known unto us.

002:016 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
        babe lying in a manger.

002:017 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
        which was told them concerning this child.

002:018 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were
        told them by the shepherds.

002:019 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her
        heart.

002:020 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
        all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told
        unto them.

002:021 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of
        the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
        the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

002:022 And when the days of her purification according to the law of
        Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
        present him to the Lord;

002:023 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that
        openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

002:024 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
        the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young
        pigeons.

002:025 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
        Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the
        consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.

002:026 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
        not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

002:027 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the
        parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the
        custom of the law,

002:028 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

002:029 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according
        to thy word:

002:030 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

002:031 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

002:032 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
        Israel.

002:033 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
        spoken of him.

002:034 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother,
        Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of
        many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;

002:035 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that
        the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

002:036 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
        of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived
        with an husband seven years from her virginity;

002:037 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which
        departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
        prayers night and day.

002:038 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
        Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption
        in Jerusalem.

002:039 And when they had performed all things according to the law of
        the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city
        Nazareth.

002:040 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
        wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

002:041 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of
        the passover.

002:042 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
        after the custom of the feast.

002:043 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the
        child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his
        mother knew not of it.

002:044 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a
        day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and
        acquaintance.

002:045 And when they found him not, they turned back again to
        Jerusalem, seeking him.

002:046 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in
        the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
        them, and asking them questions.

002:047 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding
        and answers.

002:048 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said
        unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy
        father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

002:049 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye
        not that I must be about my Father's business?

002:050 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

002:051 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
        subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in
        her heart.

002:052 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with
        God and man.

003:001 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
        Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being
        tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of
        Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the
        tetrarch of Abilene,

003:002 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
        came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

003:003 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
        baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;

003:004 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the
        prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
        Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

003:005 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill
        shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight,
        and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

003:006 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

003:007 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized
        of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee
        from the wrath to come?

003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
        not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:
        for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise
        up children unto Abraham.

003:009 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every
        tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
        down, and cast into the fire.

003:010 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

003:011 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let
        him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let
        him do likewise.

003:012 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
        Master, what shall we do?

003:013 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is
        appointed you.

003:014 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
        shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man,
        neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.

003:015 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
        their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

003:016 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with
        water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
        shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with
        the Holy Ghost and with fire:

003:017 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
        floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the
        chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

003:018 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
        people.

003:019 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
        brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had
        done,

003:020 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

003:021 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
        Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

003:022 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove
        upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art
        my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

003:023 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being
        (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of
        Heli,

003:024 Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which
        was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was
        the son of Joseph,

003:025 Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos,
        which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which
        was the son of Nagge,

003:026 Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias,
        which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which
        was the son of Juda,

003:027 Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which
        was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel,
        which was the son of Neri,

003:028 Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which
        was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was
        the son of Er,

003:029 Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which
        was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was
        the son of Levi,

003:030 Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which
        was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was
        the son of Eliakim,

003:031 Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which
        was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which
        was the son of David,

003:032 Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which
        was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was
        the son of Naasson,

003:033 Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram,
        which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which
        was the son of Juda,

003:034 Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which
        was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was
        the son of Nachor,

003:035 Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which
        was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was
        the son of Sala,

003:036 Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad,
        which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was
        the son of Lamech,

003:037 Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch,
        which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel,
        which was the son of Cainan,

003:038 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which
        was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

004:001 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,
        and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

004:002 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he
        did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward
        hungered.

004:003 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
        command this stone that it be made bread.

004:004 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall
        not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

004:005 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed
        unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

004:006 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee,
        and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to
        whomsoever I will I give it.

004:007 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

004:008 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me,
        Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
        and him only shalt thou serve.

004:009 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of
        the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast
        thyself down from hence:

004:010 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee,
        to keep thee:

004:011 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
        thou dash thy foot against a stone.

004:012 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not
        tempt the Lord thy God.

004:013 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed
        from him for a season.

004:014 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee:
        and there went out a fame of him through all the region round
        about.

004:015 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.

004:016 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as
        his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
        and stood up for to read.

004:017 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet
        Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place
        where it was written,

004:018 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me
        to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
        brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
        recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
        are bruised,

004:019 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

004:020 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister,
        and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the
        synagogue were fastened on him.

004:021 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
        fulfilled in your ears.

004:022 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
        which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this
        Joseph's son?

004:023 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this
        proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard
        done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

004:024 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in
        his own country.

004:025 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the
        days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six
        months, when great famine was throughout all the land;

004:026 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a
        city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.

004:027 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
        prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the
        Syrian.

004:028 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,
        were filled with wrath,

004:029 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto
        the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they
        might cast him down headlong.

004:030 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

004:031 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them
        on the sabbath days.

004:032 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was
        with power.

004:033 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an
        unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,

004:034 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
        of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
        art; the Holy One of God.

004:035 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
        him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came
        out of him, and hurt him not.

004:036 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,
        What a word is this! for with authority and power he
        commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.

004:037 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
        round about.

004:038 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
        house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever;
        and they besought him for her.

004:039 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:
        and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

004:040 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
        divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands
        on every one of them, and healed them.

004:041 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou
        art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them
        not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.

004:042 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:
        and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him,
        that he should not depart from them.

004:043 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to
        other cities also: for therefore am I sent.

004:044 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

005:001 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to
        hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

005:002 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were
        gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

005:003 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and
        prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land.
        And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.

005:004 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out
        into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

005:005 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all
        the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I
        will let down the net.

005:006 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude
        of fishes: and their net brake.

005:007 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
        ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
        filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.

005:008 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
        Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

005:009 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the
        draught of the fishes which they had taken:

005:010 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
        were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not;
        from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

005:011 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook
        all, and followed him.

005:012 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a
        man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and
        besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
        clean.

005:013 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be
        thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

005:014 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to
        the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses
        commanded, for a testimony unto them.

005:015 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and
        great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by
        him of their infirmities.

005:016 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

005:017 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
        there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which
        were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and
        Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

005:018 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
        palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him
        before him.

005:019 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him
        in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and
        let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst
        before Jesus.

005:020 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins
        are forgiven thee.

005:021 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who
        is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but
        God alone?

005:022 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said
        unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?

005:023 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to
        say, Rise up and walk?

005:024 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth
        to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say
        unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine
        house.

005:025 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that
        whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

005:026 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were
        filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

005:027 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican,
        named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto
        him, Follow me.

005:028 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

005:029 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there
        was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down
        with them.

005:030 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his
        disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and
        sinners?

005:031 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need
        not a physician; but they that are sick.

005:032 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

005:033 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast
        often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the
        Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?

005:034 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the
        bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

005:035 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
        away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

005:036 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece
        of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new
        maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new
        agreeth not with the old.

005:037 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new
        wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles
        shall perish.

005:038 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
        preserved.

005:039 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new:
        for he saith, The old is better.

006:001 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,
        that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples
        plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their
        hands.

006:002 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that
        which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?

006:003 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as
        this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they
        which were with him;

006:004 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the
        shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it
        is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?

006:005 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the
        sabbath.

006:006 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered
        into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right
        hand was withered.

006:007 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would
        heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation
        against him.

006:008 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
        withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he
        arose and stood forth.

006:009 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it
        lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
        life, or to destroy it?

006:010 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,
        Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was
        restored whole as the other.

006:011 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with
        another what they might do to Jesus.

006:012 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
        mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

006:013 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of
        them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;

006:014 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother,
        James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

006:015 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon
        called Zelotes,

006:016 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also
        was the traitor.

006:017 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
        company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out
        of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre
        and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their
        diseases;

006:018 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
        healed.

006:019 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went
        virtue out of him, and healed them all.

006:020 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed
        be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

006:021 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.
        Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

006:022 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
        separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and
        cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

006:023 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
        reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their
        fathers unto the prophets.

006:024 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
        consolation.

006:025 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
        that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

006:026 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
        their fathers to the false prophets.

006:027 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to
        them which hate you,

006:028 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which
        despitefully use you.

006:029 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
        other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take
        thy coat also.

006:030 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
        away thy goods ask them not again.

006:031 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
        likewise.

006:032 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
        sinners also love those that love them.

006:033 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank
        have ye? for sinners also do even the same.

006:034 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
        have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much
        again.

006:035 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
        nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be
        the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the
        unthankful and to the evil.

006:036 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

006:037 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye
        shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

006:038 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed
        down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give
        into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal
        it shall be measured to you again.

006:039 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the
        blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

006:040 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is
        perfect shall be as his master.

006:041 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
        but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

006:042 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull
        out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest
        not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast
        out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou
        see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

006:043 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth
        a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

006:044 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
        not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

006:045 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth
        forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil
        treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for
        of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

006:046 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
        say?

006:047 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth
        them, I will shew you to whom he is like:

006:048 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and
        laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the
        stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake
        it: for it was founded upon a rock.

006:049 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without
        a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the
        stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the
        ruin of that house was great.

007:001 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
        people, he entered into Capernaum.

007:002 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was
        sick, and ready to die.

007:003 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the
        Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

007:004 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly,
        saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

007:005 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

007:006 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from
        the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him,
        Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou
        shouldest enter under my roof:

007:007 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee:
        but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

007:008 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me
        soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to
        another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and
        he doeth it.

007:009 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned
        him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say
        unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

007:010 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
        servant whole that had been sick.

007:011 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city
        called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much
        people.

007:012 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
        was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and
        she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.

007:013 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
        unto her, Weep not.

007:014 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
        still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

007:015 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
        delivered him to his mother.

007:016 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,
        That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath
        visited his people.

007:017 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
        throughout all the region round about.

007:018 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

007:019 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
        Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for
        another?

007:020 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
        sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or
        look we for another?

007:021 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and
        plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he
        gave sight.

007:022 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell
        John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind
        see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
        the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.

007:023 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

007:024 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to
        speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into
        the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

007:025 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
        raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and
        live delicately, are in kings' courts.

007:026 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto
        you, and much more than a prophet.

007:027 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
        before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

007:028 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there
        is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
        least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

007:029 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans,
        justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

007:030 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God
        against themselves, being not baptized of him.

007:031 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of
        this generation? and to what are they like?

007:032 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and
        calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you,
        and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have
        not wept.

007:033 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking
        wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.

007:034 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold
        a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
        sinners!

007:035 But wisdom is justified of all her children.

007:036 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with
        him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to
        meat.

007:037 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
        knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought
        an alabaster box of ointment,

007:038 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash
        his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her
        head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
        ointment.

007:039 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
        within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would
        have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
        him: for she is a sinner.

007:040 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to
        say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

007:041 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one
        owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

007:042 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them
        both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

007:043 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave
        most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

007:044 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
        this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no
        water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and
        wiped them with the hairs of her head.

007:045 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
        in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

007:046 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
        anointed my feet with ointment.

007:047 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
        forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
        the same loveth little.

007:048 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

007:049 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
        themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

007:050 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
        peace.

008:001 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every
        city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of
        the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,

008:002 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
        infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven
        devils,

008:003 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and
        many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.

008:004 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to
        him out of every city, he spake by a parable:

008:005 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell
        by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the
        air devoured it.

008:006 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
        withered away, because it lacked moisture.

008:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,
        and choked it.

008:008 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit
        an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried,
        He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

008:009 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
        be?

008:010 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
        kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they
        might not see, and hearing they might not understand.

008:011 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

008:012 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the
        devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they
        should believe and be saved.

008:013 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the
        word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
        believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

008:014 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they
        have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and
        pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

008:015 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and
        good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth
        fruit with patience.

008:016 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a
        vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a
        candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.

008:017 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest;
        neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come
        abroad.

008:018 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him
        shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be
        taken even that which he seemeth to have.

008:019 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not
        come at him for the press.

008:020 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy
        brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

008:021 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren
        are these which hear the word of God, and do it.

008:022 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship
        with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto
        the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

008:023 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm
        of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were
        in jeopardy.

008:024 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master,
        we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging
        of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

008:025 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being
        afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is
        this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they
        obey him.

008:026 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is
        over against Galilee.

008:027 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city
        a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no
        clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.

008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and
        with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,
        thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

008:029 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
        man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound
        with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was
        driven of the devil into the wilderness.)

008:030 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said,
        Legion: because many devils were entered into him.

008:031 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out
        into the deep.

008:032 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
        mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to
        enter into them. And he suffered them.

008:033 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the
        swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the
        lake, and were choked.

008:034 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
        and told it in the city and in the country.

008:035 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,
        and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed,
        sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:
        and they were afraid.

008:036 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was
        possessed of the devils was healed.

008:037 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
        about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken
        with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned
        back again.

008:038 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
        that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

008:039 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath
        done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout
        the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.

008:040 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
        gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.

008:041 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler
        of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and
        besought him that he would come into his house:

008:042 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
        she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.

008:043 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
        spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed
        of any,

008:044 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
        immediately her issue of blood stanched.

008:045 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and
        they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng
        thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

008:046 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that
        virtue is gone out of me.

008:047 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came
        trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him
        before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and
        how she was healed immediately.

008:048 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
        hath made thee whole; go in peace.

008:049 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
        synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;
        trouble not the Master.

008:050 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:
        believe only, and she shall be made whole.

008:051 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,
        save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother
        of the maiden.

008:052 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is
        not dead, but sleepeth.

008:053 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

008:054 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
        saying, Maid, arise.

008:055 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
        commanded to give her meat.

008:056 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they
        should tell no man what was done.

009:001 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them
        power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

009:002 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
        sick.

009:003 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither
        staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have
        two coats apiece.

009:004 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence
        depart.

009:005 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that
        city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony
        against them.

009:006 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
        gospel, and healing every where.

009:007 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and
        he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John
        was risen from the dead;

009:008 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one
        of the old prophets was risen again.

009:009 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom
        I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

009:010 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that
        they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into
        a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

009:011 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he
        received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and
        healed them that had need of healing.

009:012 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
        said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into
        the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get
        victuals: for we are here in a desert place.

009:013 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
        have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should
        go and buy meat for all this people.

009:014 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
        disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

009:015 And they did so, and made them all sit down.

009:016 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking
        up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the
        disciples to set before the multitude.

009:017 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up
        of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

009:018 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples
        were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people
        that I am?

009:019 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias;
        and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

009:020 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
        said, The Christ of God.

009:021 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no
        man that thing;

009:022 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be
        rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
        slain, and be raised the third day.

009:023 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let
        him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

009:024 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever
        will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

009:025 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and
        lose himself, or be cast away?

009:026 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him
        shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own
        glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

009:027 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
        shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

009:028 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,
        he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain
        to pray.

009:029 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,
        and his raiment was white and glistering.

009:030 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses
        and Elias:

009:031 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he
        should accomplish at Jerusalem.

009:032 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:
        and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men
        that stood with him.

009:033 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said
        unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us
        make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
        one for Elias: not knowing what he said.

009:034 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed
        them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

009:035 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
        beloved Son: hear him.

009:036 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they
        kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those
        things which they had seen.

009:037 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
        down from the hill, much people met him.

009:038 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
        beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.

009:039 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and
        it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly
        departeth from him.

009:040 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could
        not.

009:041 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
        how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son
        hither.

009:042 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare
        him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the
        child, and delivered him again to his father.

009:043 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
        they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said
        unto his disciples,

009:044 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man
        shall be delivered into the hands of men.

009:045 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
        that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that
        saying.

009:046 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should
        be greatest.

009:047 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a
        child, and set him by him,

009:048 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my
        name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
        him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same
        shall be great.

009:049 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out
        devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth
        not with us.

009:050 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not
        against us is for us.

009:051 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
        received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

009:052 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and
        entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for
        him.

009:053 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though
        he would go to Jerusalem.

009:054 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,
        Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,
        and consume them, even as Elias did?

009:055 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what
        manner of spirit ye are of.

009:056 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to
        save them. And they went to another village.

009:057 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain
        man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
        goest.

009:058 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the
        air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his
        head.

009:059 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer
        me first to go and bury my father.

009:060 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou
        and preach the kingdom of God.

009:061 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me
        first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

009:062 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
        plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

010:001 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and
        sent them two and two before his face into every city and
        place, whither he himself would come.

010:002 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but
        the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the
        harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

010:003 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

010:004 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
        by the way.

010:005 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to
        this house.

010:006 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon
        it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

010:007 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things
        as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not
        from house to house.

010:008 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat
        such things as are set before you:

010:009 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
        kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

010:010 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not,
        go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,

010:011 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do
        wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that
        the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

010:012 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that
        day for Sodom, than for that city.

010:013 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
        mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been
        done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in
        sackcloth and ashes.

010:014 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
        judgment, than for you.

010:015 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
        thrust down to hell.

010:016 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
        despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent
        me.

010:017 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even
        the devils are subject unto us through thy name.

010:018 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
        heaven.

010:019 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
        scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing
        shall by any means hurt you.

010:020 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
        subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are
        written in heaven.

010:021 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee,
        O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
        things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
        babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

010:022 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man
        knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is,
        but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

010:023 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
        Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:

010:024 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to
        see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to
        hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

010:025 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,
        saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

010:026 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest
        thou?

010:027 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
        all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
        strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

010:028 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
        thou shalt live.

010:029 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
        is my neighbour?

010:030 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from
        Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped
        him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him
        half dead.

010:031 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
        when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

010:032 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
        looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

010:033 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:
        and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

010:034 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
        wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,
        and took care of him.

010:035 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
        gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;
        and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
        repay thee.

010:036 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto
        him that fell among the thieves?

010:037 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto
        him, Go, and do thou likewise.

010:038 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
        certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him
        into her house.

010:039 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'
        feet, and heard his word.

010:040 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him,
        and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me
        to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.

010:041 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
        careful and troubled about many things:

010:042 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,
        which shall not be taken away from her.

011:001 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain
        place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him,
        Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

011:002 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art
        in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
        done, as in heaven, so in earth.

011:003 Give us day by day our daily bread.

011:004 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
        indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
        us from evil.

011:005 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
        shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend
        me three loaves;

011:006 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have
        nothing to set before him?

011:007 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
        door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
        rise and give thee.

011:008 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because
        he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise
        and give him as many as he needeth.

011:009 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
        ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

011:010 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
        findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

011:011 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will
        he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish
        give him a serpent?

011:012 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?

011:013 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
        children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
        Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

011:014 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came
        to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the
        people wondered.

011:015 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
        the chief of the devils.

011:016 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.

011:017 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
        divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
        divided against a house falleth.

011:018 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his
        kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through
        Beelzebub.

011:019 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
        cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

011:020 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
        kingdom of God is come upon you.

011:021 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
        peace:

011:022 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome
        him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and
        divideth his spoils.

011:023 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth
        not with me scattereth.

011:024 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
        through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith,
        I will return unto my house whence I came out.

011:025 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

011:026 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more
        wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and
        the last state of that man is worse than the first.

011:027 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
        of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
        is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast
        sucked.

011:028 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word
        of God, and keep it.

011:029 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to
        say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there
        shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

011:030 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
        Son of man be to this generation.

011:031 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
        men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from
        the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
        and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

011:032 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
        generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the
        preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

011:033 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
        place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they
        which come in may see the light.

011:034 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is
        single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine
        eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

011:035 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
        darkness.

011:036 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
        dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright
        shining of a candle doth give thee light.

011:037 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
        him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

011:038 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not
        first washed before dinner.

011:039 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
        outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is
        full of ravening and wickedness.

011:040 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that
        which is within also?

011:041 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold,
        all things are clean unto you.

011:042 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
        manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God:
        these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
        undone.

011:043 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in
        the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

011:044 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
        graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are
        not aware of them.

011:045 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
        thus saying thou reproachest us also.

011:046 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men
        with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not
        the burdens with one of your fingers.

011:047 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
        your fathers killed them.

011:048 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:
        for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

011:049 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them
        prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and
        persecute:

011:050 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
        foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

011:051 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which
        perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto
        you, It shall be required of this generation.

011:052 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
        knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were
        entering in ye hindered.

011:053 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
        Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to
        speak of many things:

011:054 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his
        mouth, that they might accuse him.

012:001 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
        innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one
        upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all,
        Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

012:002 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;
        neither hid, that shall not be known.

012:003 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard
        in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in
        closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.

012:004 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
        the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

012:005 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which
        after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say
        unto you, Fear him.

012:006 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of
        them is forgotten before God?

012:007 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear
        not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

012:008 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men,
        him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of
        God:

012:009 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the
        angels of God.

012:010 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
        shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against
        the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.

012:011 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
        magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing
        ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

012:012 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye
        ought to say.

012:013 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
        brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

012:014 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider
        over you?

012:015 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness:
        for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
        which he possesseth.

012:016 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
        certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

012:017 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,
        because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?

012:018 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and
        build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my
        goods.

012:019 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
        for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

012:020 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
        required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou
        hast provided?

012:021 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich
        toward God.

012:022 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
        no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the
        body, what ye shall put on.

012:023 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.

012:024 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
        neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how
        much more are ye better than the fowls?

012:025 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature
        one cubit?

012:026 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why
        take ye thought for the rest?

012:027 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin
        not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was
        not arrayed like one of these.

012:028 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
        and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he
        clothe you, O ye of little faith?

012:029 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
        neither be ye of doubtful mind.

012:030 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after:
        and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

012:031 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
        shall be added unto you.

012:032 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
        to give you the kingdom.

012:033 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags
        which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not,
        where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

012:034 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

012:035 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;

012:036 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when
        he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and
        knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.

012:037 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
        find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird
        himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come
        forth and serve them.

012:038 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
        watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

012:039 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
        hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have
        suffered his house to be broken through.

012:040 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an
        hour when ye think not.

012:041 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable
        unto us, or even to all?

012:042 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward,
        whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give
        them their portion of meat in due season?

012:043 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
        find so doing.

012:044 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over
        all that he hath.

012:045 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
        coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens,
        and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

012:046 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh
        not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut
        him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the
        unbelievers.

012:047 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
        himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten
        with many stripes.

012:048 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
        shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is
        given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have
        committed much, of him they will ask the more.

012:049 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
        already kindled?

012:050 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I
        straitened till it be accomplished!

012:051 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you,
        Nay; but rather division:

012:052 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
        three against two, and two against three.

012:053 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son
        against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the
        daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her
        daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in
        law.

012:054 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out
        of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so
        it is.

012:055 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be
        heat; and it cometh to pass.

012:056 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
        earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?

012:057 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

012:058 When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as
        thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be
        delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the
        judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee
        into prison.

012:059 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid
        the very last mite.

013:001 There were present at that season some that told him of the
        Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their
        sacrifices.

013:002 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these
        Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they
        suffered such things?

013:003 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
        perish.

013:004 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and
        slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that
        dwelt in Jerusalem?

013:005 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
        perish.

013:006 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree
        planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon,
        and found none.

013:007 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
        three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find
        none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?

013:008 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year
        also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:

013:009 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou
        shalt cut it down.

013:010 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

013:011 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
        eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise
        lift up herself.

013:012 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto
        her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

013:013 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
        straight, and glorified God.

013:014 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
        because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said
        unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to
        work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the
        sabbath day.

013:015 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
        each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from
        the stall, and lead him away to watering?

013:016 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom
        Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from
        this bond on the sabbath day?

013:017 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were
        ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious
        things that were done by him.

013:018 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
        whereunto shall I resemble it?

013:019 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast
        into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the
        fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.

013:020 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?

013:021 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three
        measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

013:022 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
        journeying toward Jerusalem.

013:023 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And
        he said unto them,

013:024 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto
        you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

013:025 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut
        to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at
        the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall
        answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:

013:026 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy
        presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

013:027 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
        depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

013:028 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall
        see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in
        the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.

013:029 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
        the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the
        kingdom of God.

013:030 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there
        are first which shall be last.

013:031 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto
        him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

013:032 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I
        cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the
        third day I shall be perfected.

013:033 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
        following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
        Jerusalem.

013:034 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and
        stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have
        gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood
        under her wings, and ye would not!

013:035 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say
        unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye
        shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

014:001 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
        chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they
        watched him.

014:002 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
        dropsy.

014:003 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees,
        saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

014:004 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him,
        and let him go;

014:005 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or
        an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out
        on the sabbath day?

014:006 And they could not answer him again to these things.

014:007 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
        marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.

014:008 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in
        the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be
        bidden of him;

014:009 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this
        man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

014:010 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
        that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee,
        Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the
        presence of them that sit at meat with thee.

014:011 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
        humbleth himself shall be exalted.

014:012 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
        dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren,
        neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also
        bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

014:013 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
        lame, the blind:

014:014 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee:
        for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

014:015 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
        things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread
        in the kingdom of God.

014:016 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
        bade many:

014:017 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were
        bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.

014:018 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
        said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must
        needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

014:019 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
        prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

014:020 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I
        cannot come.

014:021 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then
        the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go
        out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring
        in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the
        blind.

014:022 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
        and yet there is room.

014:023 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways
        and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be
        filled.

014:024 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
        shall taste of my supper.

014:025 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
        said unto them,

014:026 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,
        and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
        his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

014:027 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me,
        cannot be my disciple.

014:028 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
        first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to
        finish it?

014:029 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able
        to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,

014:030 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

014:031 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
        not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten
        thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty
        thousand?

014:032 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
        ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

014:033 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all
        that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

014:034 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
        shall it be seasoned?

014:035 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but
        men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

015:001 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to
        hear him.

015:002 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
        receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

015:003 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

015:004 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of
        them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness,
        and go after that which is lost, until he find it?

015:005 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
        rejoicing.

015:006 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
        neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have
        found my sheep which was lost.

015:007 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
        sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
        persons, which need no repentance.

015:008 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
        piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek
        diligently till she find it?

015:009 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her
        neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found
        the piece which I had lost.

015:010 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
        angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

015:011 And he said, A certain man had two sons:

015:012 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me
        the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto
        them his living.

015:013 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
        and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
        substance with riotous living.

015:014 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
        land; and he began to be in want.

015:015 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
        and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

015:016 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
        the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

015:017 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
        of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish
        with hunger!

015:018 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
        Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

015:019 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of
        thy hired servants.

015:020 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
        great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
        ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

015:021 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
        heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called
        thy son.

015:022 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
        robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
        on his feet:

015:023 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
        and be merry:

015:024 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and
        is found. And they began to be merry.

015:025 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
        nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

015:026 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
        meant.

015:027 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
        killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
        sound.

015:028 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
        father out, and intreated him.

015:029 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
        serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy
        commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might
        make merry with my friends:

015:030 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy
        living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

015:031 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
        I have is thine.

015:032 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
        thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
        found.

016:001 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
        man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him
        that he had wasted his goods.

016:002 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear
        this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou
        mayest be no longer steward.

016:003 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
        lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg
        I am ashamed.

016:004 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
        stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

016:005 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and
        said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

016:006 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him,
        Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

016:007 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said,
        An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy
        bill, and write fourscore.

016:008 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
        wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation
        wiser than the children of light.

016:009 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon
        of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you
        into everlasting habitations.

016:010 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
        much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in
        much.

016:011 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
        mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?

016:012 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another
        man's, who shall give you that which is your own?

016:013 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
        one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
        despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

016:014 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
        things: and they derided him.

016:015 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
        before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is
        highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

016:016 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
        kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

016:017 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
        of the law to fail.

016:018 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
        committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put
        away from her husband committeth adultery.

016:019 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
        fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

016:020 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid
        at his gate, full of sores,

016:021 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
        rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

016:022 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
        the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
        was buried;

016:023 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
        Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

016:024 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
        send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
        and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

016:025 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
        receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things:
        but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

016:026 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
        fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
        neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.

016:027 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
        wouldest send him to my father's house:

016:028 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest
        they also come into this place of torment.

016:029 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
        them hear them.

016:030 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
        from the dead, they will repent.

016:031 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
        neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

017:001 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
        offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!

017:002 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
        neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one
        of these little ones.

017:003 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
        rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

017:004 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
        seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent;
        thou shalt forgive him.

017:005 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

017:006 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed,
        ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by
        the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey
        you.

017:007 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
        will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field,
        Go and sit down to meat?

017:008 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may
        sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and
        drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

017:009 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were
        commanded him? I trow not.

017:010 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
        are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have
        done that which was our duty to do.

017:011 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
        through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

017:012 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten
        men that were lepers, which stood afar off:

017:013 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have
        mercy on us.

017:014 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves
        unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went,
        they were cleansed.

017:015 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
        and with a loud voice glorified God,

017:016 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and
        he was a Samaritan.

017:017 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but
        where are the nine?

017:018 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save
        this stranger.

017:019 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
        thee whole.

017:020 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
        God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God
        cometh not with observation:

017:021 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,
        the kingdom of God is within you.

017:022 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
        shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye
        shall not see it.

017:023 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not
        after them, nor follow them.

017:024 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part
        under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so
        shall also the Son of man be in his day.

017:025 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
        generation.

017:026 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
        days of the Son of man.

017:027 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given
        in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and
        the flood came, and destroyed them all.

017:028 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
        drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

017:029 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
        brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

017:030 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
        revealed.

017:031 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his
        stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and
        he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

017:032 Remember Lot's wife.

017:033 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
        whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

017:034 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed;
        the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

017:035 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
        and the other left.

017:036 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
        other left.

017:037 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
        unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be
        gathered together.

018:001 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
        always to pray, and not to faint;

018:002 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,
        neither regarded man:

018:003 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him,
        saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.

018:004 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
        himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

018:005 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest
        by her continual coming she weary me.

018:006 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

018:007 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and
        night unto him, though he bear long with them?

018:008 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
        when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

018:009 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
        themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

018:010 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
        and the other a publican.

018:011 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
        thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
        adulterers, or even as this publican.

018:012 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

018:013 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
        as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
        God be merciful to me a sinner.

018:014 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
        than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be
        abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

018:015 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch
        them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

018:016 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little
        children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is
        the kingdom of God.

018:017 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
        of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

018:018 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall
        I do to inherit eternal life?

018:019 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is
        good, save one, that is, God.

018:020 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
        kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy
        father and thy mother.

018:021 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

018:022 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet
        lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and
        distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
        heaven: and come, follow me.

018:023 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
        rich.

018:024 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
        hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
        God!

018:025 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye,
        than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

018:026 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

018:027 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are
        possible with God.

018:028 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

018:029 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
        that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or
        children, for the kingdom of God's sake,

018:030 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and
        in the world to come life everlasting.

018:031 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
        we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
        prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

018:032 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
        mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:

018:033 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the
        third day he shall rise again.

018:034 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
        hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

018:035 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
        certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

018:036 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

018:037 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

018:038 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
        me.

018:039 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
        his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David,
        have mercy on me.

018:040 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and
        when he was come near, he asked him,

018:041 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,
        Lord, that I may receive my sight.

018:042 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath
        saved thee.

018:043 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
        glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave
        praise unto God.

019:001 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

019:002 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the
        chief among the publicans, and he was rich.

019:003 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
        press, because he was little of stature.

019:004 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
        him: for he was to pass that way.

019:005 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,
        and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
        to day I must abide at thy house.

019:006 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

019:007 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was
        gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

019:008 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the
        half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any
        thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him
        fourfold.

019:009 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
        house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

019:010 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
        lost.

019:011 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
        because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought
        that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.

019:012 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country
        to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

019:013 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
        and said unto them, Occupy till I come.

019:014 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
        saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

019:015 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having
        received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be
        called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might
        know how much every man had gained by trading.

019:016 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
        pounds.

019:017 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou
        hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over
        ten cities.

019:018 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
        pounds.

019:019 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.

019:020 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,
        which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

019:021 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou
        takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou
        didst not sow.

019:022 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge
        thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
        man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did
        not sow:

019:023 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at
        my coming I might have required mine own with usury?

019:024 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound,
        and give it to him that hath ten pounds.

019:025 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)

019:026 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be
        given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be
        taken away from him.

019:027 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign
        over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

019:028 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
        Jerusalem.

019:029 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
        Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two
        of his disciples,

019:030 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which
        at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never
        man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.

019:031 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
        unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

019:032 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he
        had said unto them.

019:033 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said
        unto them, Why loose ye the colt?

019:034 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

019:035 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments
        upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

019:036 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

019:037 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the
        mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to
        rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty
        works that they had seen;

019:038 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the
        Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

019:039 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
        him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

019:040 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these
        should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

019:041 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over
        it,

019:042 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
        day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are
        hid from thine eyes.

019:043 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
        cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep
        thee in on every side,

019:044 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children
        within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon
        another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

019:045 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
        sold therein, and them that bought;

019:046 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of
        prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.

019:047 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and
        the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

019:048 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were
        very attentive to hear him.

020:001 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught
        the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief
        priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,

020:002 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest
        thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?

020:003 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one
        thing; and answer me:

020:004 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?

020:005 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
        From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?

020:006 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for
        they be persuaded that John was a prophet.

020:007 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.

020:008 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority
        I do these things.

020:009 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain
        man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and
        went into a far country for a long time.

020:010 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that
        they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the
        husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.

020:011 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
        entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

020:012 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
        him out.

020:013 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will
        send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when
        they see him.

020:014 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among
        themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him,
        that the inheritance may be ours.

020:015 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
        therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

020:016 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the
        vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God
        forbid.

020:017 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is
        written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is
        become the head of the corner?

020:018 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on
        whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

020:019 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
        lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they
        perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.

020:020 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
        themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words,
        that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of
        the governor.

020:021 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest
        and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of
        any, but teachest the way of God truly:

020:022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?

020:023 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why
        tempt ye me?

020:024 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They
        answered and said, Caesar's.

020:025 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
        which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.

020:026 And they could not take hold of his words before the people:
        and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

020:027 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
        there is any resurrection; and they asked him,

020:028 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die,
        having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother
        should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

020:029 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a
        wife, and died without children.

020:030 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

020:031 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
        they left no children, and died.

020:032 Last of all the woman died also.

020:033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
        seven had her to wife.

020:034 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
        marry, and are given in marriage:

020:035 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,
        and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
        given in marriage:

020:036 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
        angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
        resurrection.

020:037 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
        when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of
        Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

020:038 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all
        live unto him.

020:039 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
        well said.

020:040 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.

020:041 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's
        son?

020:042 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
        unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

020:043 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

020:044 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?

020:045 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his
        disciples,

020:046 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
        love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the
        synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;

020:047 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers:
        the same shall receive greater damnation.

021:001 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts
        into the treasury.

021:002 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
        mites.

021:003 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow
        hath cast in more than they all:

021:004 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the
        offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the
        living that she had.

021:005 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with
        goodly stones and gifts, he said,

021:006 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in
        the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that
        shall not be thrown down.

021:007 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these
        things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall
        come to pass?

021:008 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall
        come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth
        near: go ye not therefore after them.

021:009 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not
        terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the
        end is not by and by.

021:010 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
        kingdom against kingdom:

021:011 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,
        and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall
        there be from heaven.

021:012 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
        persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into
        prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's
        sake.

021:013 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

021:014 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before
        what ye shall answer:

021:015 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
        adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

021:016 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
        kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be
        put to death.

021:017 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.

021:018 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

021:019 In your patience possess ye your souls.

021:020 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
        know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

021:021 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and
        let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not
        them that are in the countries enter thereinto.

021:022 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
        written may be fulfilled.

021:023 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
        suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the
        land, and wrath upon this people.

021:024 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
        away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden
        down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
        fulfilled.

021:025 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in
        the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with
        perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

021:026 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
        those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of
        heaven shall be shaken.

021:027 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
        power and great glory.

021:028 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
        lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

021:029 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all
        the trees;

021:030 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves
        that summer is now nigh at hand.

021:031 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
        that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

021:032 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
        till all be fulfilled.

021:033 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
        away.

021:034 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
        overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of
        this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

021:035 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the
        face of the whole earth.

021:036 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
        worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and
        to stand before the Son of man.

021:037 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at
        night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the
        mount of Olives.

021:038 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
        temple, for to hear him.

022:001 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called
        the Passover.

022:002 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill
        him; for they feared the people.

022:003 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
        number of the twelve.

022:004 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
        captains, how he might betray him unto them.

022:005 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

022:006 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
        them in the absence of the multitude.

022:007 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must
        be killed.

022:008 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
        passover, that we may eat.

022:009 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

022:010 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the
        city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;
        follow him into the house where he entereth in.

022:011 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
        saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
        the pass
